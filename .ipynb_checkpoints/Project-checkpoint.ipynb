despise;\\nThe ancients only, or the moderns prize.\\nThus wit, like faith, by each man is applied\\nTo one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.\\nMeanly they seek the blessing to confine,\\nAnd force that sun but on a part to shine,\\nWhich not alone the southern wit sublimes,\\nBut ripens spirits in cold northern climes;\\nWhich from the first has shone on ages past,\\nEnlights the present, and shall warm the last;\\nThough each may feel increases and decays,\\nAnd see now clearer and now darker days.\\nRegard not then if wit be old or new,\\nBut blame the false, and value still the true.\\nSome ne'er advance a judgment of their own,\\nBut catch the spreading notion of the town;\\nThey reason and conclude by precedent,\\nAnd own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.\\nSome

revive;\\nStones leap'd to form, and rocks began to live;\\nWith sweeter notes each rising temple rung:\\nA Raphael painted, and a Vida sung:\\nImmortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow\\nThe poet's bays and critic's ivy grow;\\nCremona now shall ever boast thy name,\\nAs next in place to Mantua, next in fame!\\nBut soon by impious arms from Latium chased,\\nTheir ancient bounds the banish'd Muses pass'd;\\nThence Arts o'er all the northern world advance,\\nBut critic-learning flourish'd most in France:\\nThe rules a nation, born to serve, obeys;\\nAnd Boileau still in right of Horace sways.\\nBut we, brave Britons, foreign laws despised,\\nAnd kept unconquer'd and uncivilised;\\nFierce for the liberties of wit, and bold,\\nWe still defied the Romans, as of old.\\nYet some there were, among the sounder few\\nOf those who less presumed, and better knew,\\nWho durst assert the juster ancient cause,\\nAnd here restored Wit's fundamental laws.\\nSuch was the Muse, whose rules and practice tell,\\n'Nature's chief masterpiece is writing well.'\\nSuch was Roscommon, not more learn'd than good,\\nWith manners generous as his noble blood;\\nTo him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,\\nAnd every author's merit, but his own.\\nSuch late was Walsh--the Muse's judge and friend,\\nWho justly knew to blame or to commend;\\nTo failings mild, but zealous for desert;\\nThe clearest head, and the sincerest heart.\\nThis humble praise, lamented Shade! receive,\\nThis praise at least a grateful Muse may give:\\nThe Muse, whose early voice you taught to sing,\\nPrescribed her heights, and pruned her tender wing,\\n(Her guide now lost) no more attempts to rise,\\nBut in low numbers short excursions tries:\\nContent, if hence the unlearn'd their wants may view,\\nThe learn'd reflect on what before they knew:\\nCareless of censure, nor too fond of fame;\\nStill pleased to praise, yet not afraid to blame;\\nAverse alike to flatter, or offend;\\nNot free from faults, nor yet too vain to mend.\\nWhat dire offence from amorous causes springs,\\nWhat mighty contests rise from trivial things,\\nI sing--This verse to Caryll, Muse! is due:\\nThis, even Belinda may vouchsafe to view:\\nSlight is the subject, but not so the praise,\\nIf she inspire, and he approve my lays.\\nSay what strange motive, Goddess! could compel\\nA well-bred lord t'assault a gentle belle?\\nOh, say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,\\nCould make a gentle belle reject a lord?\\nIn tasks so bold, can little men engage,\\nAnd in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage?\\nSol through white curtains shot a timorous ray,\\nAnd oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:\\nNow lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,\\nAnd sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:\\nThrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,\\nAnd the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.\\nBelinda still her downy pillow press'd,\\nHer guardian Sylph prolong'd the balmy rest:\\n'Twas he had summon'd to her silent bed\\nThe morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head,\\nA youth more glittering than a birth-night beau,\\n(That even in slumber caused her cheek to glow),\\nSeem'd to her ear his willing lips to lay,\\nAnd thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say:\\n'Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care\\nOf thousand bright inhabitants of air!\\nIf e'er one vision touch thy infant thought,\\nOf all the nurse and all the priest have taught;\\nOf airy elves by moonlight shadows seen,\\nThe silver token, and the circled green,\\nOr virgins visited by angel-powers,\\nWith golden crowns and wreaths of heavenly flowers;\\nHear and believe! thy own importance know,\\nNor bound thy narrow views to things below.\\nSome secret truths, from learned pride conceal'd,\\nTo maids alone and children are reveal'd:\\nWhat though no credit doubting wits may give?\\nThe fair and innocent shall still believe.\\nKnow then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly,\\nThe light militia of the lower sky:\\nThese, though unseen, are ever on the wing,\\nHang o'er the box, and hover round the ring.\\nThink what an equipage thou hast in air,\\nAnd view with scorn two pages and a chair.\\nAs now your own, our beings were of old,\\nAnd once enclosed in woman's beauteous mould;\\nThence, by a soft transition, we repair\\nFrom earthly vehicles to these of air.\\nThink not, when woman's transient breath is fled,\\nThat all her vanities at once are dead;\\nSucceeding vanities she still regards,\\nAnd though she plays no more, o'erlooks the cards.\\nHer joy in gilded chariots, when alive,\\nAnd love of ombre, after death survive.\\nFor when the fair in all their pride expire,\\nTo their first elements their souls retire:\\nThe sprites of fiery termagants in flame\\nMount up, and take a Salamander's name.\\nSoft yielding minds to water glide away,\\nAnd sip, with Nymphs, their elemental tea.\\nThe graver prude sinks downward to a Gnome,\\nIn search of mischief still on earth to roam.\\nThe light coquettes in Sylphs aloft repair,\\nAnd sport and flutter in the fields of air.\\n'Know further yet; whoever fair and chaste\\nRejects mankind, is by some Sylph embraced:\\nFor spirits, freed from mortal laws, with ease\\nAssume what sexes and what shapes they please.\\nWhat guards the purity of melting maids,\\nIn courtly balls, and midnight masquerades,\\nSafe from the treacherous friend, the daring spark,\\nThe glance by day, the whisper in the dark,\\nWhen kind occasion prompts their warm desires,\\nWhen music softens, and when dancing fires?\\n'Tis but their Sylph, the wise celestials know,\\nThough honour is the word with men below.\\n'Some nymphs there are, too conscious of their face,\\nFor life predestined to the Gnomes' embrace.\\nThese swell their prospects, and exalt their pride,\\nWhen offers are disdain'd, and love denied;\\nThen gay ideas crowd the vacant brain,\\nWhile peers, and dukes, and all their sweeping train,\\nAnd garters, stars, and coronets appear,\\nAnd in soft sounds, 'Your Grace' salutes their ear.\\n'Tis these that early taint the female soul,\\nInstruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll,\\nTeach infant cheeks a bidden blush to know,\\nAnd little hearts to flutter at a beau.\\n'Oft, when the world imagine women stray,\\nThe Sylphs through mystic mazes guide their way,\\nThrough all the giddy circle they pursue,\\nAnd old impertinence expel by new.\\nWhat tender maid but must a victim fall\\nTo one man's treat, but for another's ball?\\nWhen Florio speaks, what virgin could withstand,\\nIf gentle Damon did not squeeze her hand?\\nWith varying vanities, from every part,\\nThey shift the moving toyshop of their heart,\\nWhere wigs with wigs, with sword-knots sword-knots strive,\\nBeaux banish beaux, and coaches coaches drive.\\nThis erring mortals levity may call,\\nOh, blind to truth! the Sylphs contrive it all.\\n'Of these am I, who thy protection claim,\\nA watchful sprite, and Ariel is my name.\\nLate, as I ranged the crystal wilds of air,\\nIn the clear mirror of thy ruling star\\nI saw, alas! some dread event impend,\\nEre to the main this morning sun descend,\\nBut heaven reveals not what, or how, or where:\\nWarn'd by the Sylph, oh, pious maid, beware!\\nThis to disclose is all thy guardian can:\\nBeware of all, but most beware of man!'\\nHe said; when Shock, who thought she slept too long,\\nLeap'd up, and waked his mistress with his tongue.\\n'Twas then, Belinda, if report say true,\\nThy eyes first open'd on a billet-doux;\\nWounds, charms, and ardours, were no sooner read,\\nBut all the vision vanish'd from thy head.\\nAnd now, unveil'd, the toilet stands display'd,\\nEach silver vase in mystic order laid.\\nFirst, robed in white, the nymph intent adores,\\nWith head uncover'd, the cosmetic powers.\\nA heavenly image in the glass appears,\\nTo that she bends, to that her eyes she rears;\\nThe inferior priestess, at her altar's side,\\nTrembling, begins the sacred rites of pride.\\nUnnumber'd treasures ope at once, and here\\nThe various offerings of the world appear;\\nFrom each she nicely culls with curious toil,\\nAnd decks the goddess with the glittering spoil.\\nThis casket India's glowing gems unlocks,\\nAnd all Arabia breathes from yonder box.\\nThe tortoise here, and elephant unite,\\nTransform'd to combs, the speckled and the white.\\nHere files of pins extend their shining rows,\\nPuffs, powders, patches, Bibles, billet-doux.\\nNow awful beauty puts on all its arms;\\nThe fair each moment rises in her charms,\\nRepairs her smiles, awakens every grace,\\nAnd calls forth all the wonders of her face;\\nSees by degrees a purer blush arise,\\nAnd keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.\\nThe busy Sylphs surround their darling care,\\nThese set the head, and those divide the hair,\\nSome fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:\\nAnd Betty's praised for labours not her own.\\nNot with more glories, in the ethereal plain,\\nThe sun first rises o'er the purpled main,\\nThan, issuing forth, the rival of his beams\\nLaunched on the bosom of the silver Thames.\\nFair nymphs and well-dress'd youths around her shone,\\nBut every eye was fix'd on her alone.\\nOn her white breast a sparkling cross she wore,\\nWhich Jews might kiss, and infidels adore.\\nHer lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,\\nQuick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:\\nFavours to none, to all she smiles extends;\\nOft she rejects, but never once offends.\\nBright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,\\nAnd, like the sun, they shine on all alike.\\nYet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride\\nMight hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:\\nIf to her share some female errors fall,\\nLook on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.\\nThis nymph, to the destruction of mankind,\\nNourish'd two locks, which graceful hung behind\\nIn equal curls, and well conspired to deck\\nWith shining ringlets the smooth ivory neck.\\nLove in these labyrinths his slaves detains,\\nAnd mighty hearts are held in slender chains.\\nWith hairy springes we the birds betray,\\nSlight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,\\nFair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,\\nAnd beauty draws us with a single hair.\\nThe adventurous Baron the bright locks admired;\\nHe saw, he wished, and to the prize aspired.\\nResolved to win, he meditates the way,\\nBy force to ravish, or by fraud betray;\\nFor when success a lover's toil attends,\\nFew ask if fraud or force attain'd his ends.\\nFor this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored\\nPropitious Heaven, and every power adored,\\nBut chiefly Love--to Love an altar built,\\nOf twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.\\nThere lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;\\nAnd all the trophies of his former loves;\\nWith tender billet-doux he lights the pyre,\\nAnd breathes three amorous sighs to raise the fire.\\nThen prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes\\nSoon to obtain, and long possess the prize:\\nThe powers gave ear, and granted half his prayer,\\nThe rest, the winds dispersed in empty air.\\nBut now secure the painted vessel glides,\\nThe sunbeams trembling on the floating tides:\\nWhile melting music steals upon the sky,\\nAnd soften'd sounds along the waters die;\\nSmooth flow the waves, the zephyrs gently play,\\nBelinda smiled, and all the world was gay.\\nAll but the Sylph--with careful thoughts oppress'd,\\nThe impending woe sat heavy on his breast.\\nHe summons straight his denizens of air;\\nThe lucid squadrons round the sails repair;\\nSoft o'er the shrouds aÃ«rial whispers breathe,\\nThat seem'd but zephyrs to the train beneath.\\nSome to the sun their insect-wings unfold,\\nWaft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;\\nTransparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,\\nTheir fluid bodies half dissolved in light.\\nLoose to the wind their airy garments flew,\\nThin glittering textures of the filmy dew,\\nDipp'd in the richest tincture of the skies,\\nWhere light disports in ever-mingling dyes;\\nWhile every beam new transient colours flings,\\nColours that change whene'er they wave their wings.\\nAmid the circle, on the gilded mast,\\nSuperior by the head, was Ariel placed;\\nHis purple pinions opening to the sun,\\nHe raised his azure wand, and thus begun:\\n'Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear,\\nFays, fairies, genii, elves, and demons hear!\\nYe know the spheres, and various tasks assign'd\\nBy laws eternal to the aÃ«rial kind.\\nSome in the fields of purest ether play,\\nAnd bask and whiten in the blaze of day:\\nSome guide the course of wandering orbs on high,\\nOr roll the planets through the boundless sky:\\nSome, less refined, beneath the moon's pale light\\nPursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,\\nOr suck the mists in grosser air below,\\nOr dip their pinions in the painted bow,\\nOr brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,\\nOr o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.\\nOthers on earth o'er human race preside,\\nWatch all their ways, and all their actions guide:\\nOf these the chief the care of nations own,\\nAnd guard with arms divine the British throne.\\n'Our humbler province is to tend the fair,\\nNot a less pleasing, though less glorious care;\\nTo save the powder from too rude a gale,\\nNor let the imprison'd essences exhale;\\nTo draw fresh colours from the vernal flowers;\\nTo steal from rainbows, ere they drop in showers,\\nA brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,\\nAssist their blushes, and inspire their airs;\\nNay, oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,\\nTo change a flounce, or add a furbelow.\\n'This day, black omens threat the brightest fair\\nThat e'er deserved a watchful spirit's care;\\nSome dire disaster, or by force, or flight;\\nBut what, or where, the Fates have wrapt in night.\\nWhether the nymph shall break Diana's law,\\nOr some frail China jar receive a flaw;\\nOr stain her honour, or her new brocade;\\nForget her prayers, or miss a masquerade;\\nOr lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;\\nOr whether Heaven has doom'd that Shock must fall,\\nHaste then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:\\nThe fluttering fan be Zephyretta's care;\\nThe drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;\\nAnd, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;\\nDo thou, Crispissa, tend her favourite lock;\\nAriel himself shall be the guard of Shock.\\n'To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,\\nWe trust the important charge, the petticoat:\\nOft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail,\\nThough stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;\\nForm a strong line about the silver bound,\\nAnd guard the wide circumference around.\\n'Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,\\nHis post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,\\nShall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,\\nBe stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;\\nOr plunged in lakes of bitter washes lie,\\nOr wedged whole ages in a bodkin's eye:\\nGums and pomatums shall his flight restrain,\\nWhile, clogg'd, he beats his silken wings in vain;\\nOr alum styptics with contracting power\\nShrink his thin essence like a rivell'd flower:\\nOr, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel\\nThe giddy motion of the whirling mill,\\nIn fumes of burning chocolate shall glow,\\nAnd tremble at the sea that froths below!'\\nHe spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;\\nSome, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;\\nSome thread the mazy ringlets of her hair;\\nSome hang upon the pendants of her ear;\\nWith beating hearts the dire event they wait,\\nAnxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.\\nClose by those meads, for ever crown'd with flowers,\\nWhere Thames with pride surveys his rising towers,\\nThere stands a structure of majestic frame,\\nWhich from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.\\nHere Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom\\nOf foreign tyrants, and of nymphs at home;\\nHere thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,\\nDost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.\\nHither the heroes and the nymphs resort,\\nTo taste awhile the pleasures of a court;\\nIn various talk the instructive hours they pass'd,\\nWho gave the ball, or paid the visit last;\\nOne speaks the glory of the British Queen,\\nAnd one describes a charming Indian screen;\\nA third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;\\nAt every word a reputation dies.\\nSnuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,\\nWith singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.\\nMeanwhile, declining from the noon of day,\\nThe sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;\\nThe hungry judges soon the sentence sign,\\nAnd wretches hang that jurymen may dine;\\nThe merchant from the Exchange returns in peace,\\nAnd the long labours of the toilet cease.\\nBelinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,\\nBurns to encounter two adventurous knights,\\nAt ombre singly to decide their doom,\\nAnd swells her breast with conquests yet to come.\\nStraight the three bands prepare in arras to join,\\nEach band the number of the sacred Nine.\\nSoon as she spreads her hand, the aÃ«rial guard\\nDescend, and sit on each important card:\\nFirst Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,\\nThen each, according to the rank they bore;\\nFor Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,\\nAre, as when women, wondrous fond of place.\\nBehold, four Kings in majesty revered,\\nWith hoary whiskers and a forky beard;\\nAnd four fair Queens, whose hands sustain a flower,\\nTh' expressive emblem of their softer power;\\nFour Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,\\nCaps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;\\nAnd particolour'd troops, a shining train,\\nDraw forth to combat on the velvet plain.\\nThe skilful nymph reviews her force with

eighteen;\\nPractised to lisp, and hang the head aside,\\nFaints into airs, and languishes with pride;\\nOn the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,\\nWrapp'd in a gown, for sickness, and for show.\\nThe fair ones feel such maladies as these,\\nWhen each new night-dress gives a new disease.\\nA constant vapour o'er the palace flies,\\nStrange phantoms rising as the mists arise;\\nDreadful, as hermits' dreams in haunted shades,\\nOr bright, as visions of expiring maids.\\nNow glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,\\nPale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:\\nNow lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,\\nAnd crystal domes, and angels in machines.\\nUnnumber'd throngs on every side are seen\\nOf bodies changed to various forms by Spleen.\\nHere living teapots stand, one

ah, ten times happy had I been,\\nIf Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!\\nYet am not I the first mistaken maid,\\nBy love of courts to numerous ills betray'd.\\nOh, had I rather unadmired remain'd\\nIn some lone isle, or distant northern land;\\nWhere the gilt chariot never marks the way,\\nWhere none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea!\\nThere kept my charms conceal'd from mortal eye,\\nLike roses that in deserts bloom and die.\\nWhat moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?\\nOh, had I stay'd, and said my prayers at home!\\n'Twas this the morning omens seem'd to tell:\\nThrice from my trembling hand the patch-box fell;\\nThe tottering china shook without a wind,\\nNay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!\\nA Sylph too warn'd me of the threats of Fate,\\nIn mystic visions, now believed too late.\\nSee the poor remnants of these slighted hairs!\\nMy hands shall rend what ev'n thy rapine spares:\\nThese in two sable ringlets taught to break,\\nOnce gave new beauties to the snowy neck;\\nThe sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,\\nAnd in its fellow's fate foresees its own;\\nUncurl'd it hangs, the fatal shears demands,\\nAnd tempts, once more, thy sacrilegious hands.\\nOh hadst thou, cruel! been content to seize\\nHairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!'\\nShe said: the pitying audience melt in tears;\\nBut Fate and Jove had stopp'd the Baron's ears.\\nIn vain Thalestris with reproach assails,\\nFor who can move when fair Belinda fails?\\nNot half so fix'd the Trojan could remain,\\nWhile Anna begg'd and Dido raged in vain.\\nThen grave Clarissa graceful waved her fan;\\nSilence ensued, and thus the nymph began:\\n'Say, why are beauties praised and honour'd most,\\nThe wise man's passion, and the vain man's toast?\\nWhy deck'd with all that land and sea afford?\\nWhy angels call'd, and angel-like adored?\\nWhy round our coaches crowd the white-gloved beaux?\\nWhy bows the side-box from its inmost rows?\\nHow vain are all these glories, all our pains,\\nUnless good sense preserve what beauty gains:\\nThat men may say, when we the front-box grace,\\nBehold the first in virtue as in face!\\nOh!

compose,\\nAnd mount the hill in venerable rows:\\nThere the green infants in their beds are laid,\\nThe garden's hope, and its expected shade.\\nHere orange-trees with blooms and pendants shine,\\nAnd vernal honours to their autumn join;\\nExceed their promise in the ripen'd store,\\nYet in the rising blossom promise more.\\nThere in bright drops the crystal fountains play,\\nBy laurels shielded from the piercing day:\\nWhere Daphne, now a tree, as once a maid,\\nStill from Apollo vindicates her shade,\\nStill turns her beauties from the invading beam,\\nNor seeks in vain for succour to the stream.\\nThe stream at once preserves her virgin leaves,\\nAt once a shelter from her boughs receives,\\nWhere summer's beauty midst of winter stays,\\nAnd winter's coolness spite of summer's rays.\\n\\nWhile Celia's tears make sorrow bright,\\nProud grief sits swelling in her eyes;\\nThe sun, next those the fairest light,\\nThus from the ocean first did rise:\\nAnd thus through mists we see the sun,\\nWhich, else we durst not gaze upon.\\nThese silver drops, like morning dew,\\nForetell the fervour of the day:\\nSo from one cloud soft showers we view,\\nAnd blasting lightnings burst away.\\nThe stars that fall from Celia's eye,\\nDeclare our doom in drawing nigh.\\nThe baby in that sunny sphere\\nSo like a PhaÃ«ton appears,\\nThat Heaven, the threaten'd world to spare,\\nThought fit to drown him in her tears:\\nElse might the ambitious nymph aspire,\\nTo set, like him, Heaven too on fire.\\nSilence! coeval with eternity;\\nThou wert, ere Nature's self began to be,\\n'Twas one vast Nothing all, and all slept fast in thee.\\nThine was the sway, ere heaven was form'd, or earth,\\nEre fruitful Thought conceived Creation's birth,\\nOr midwife Word gave aid, and spoke the infant forth.\\nThen various elements against thee join'd,\\nIn one more various animal combined,\\nAnd framed the clamorous race of busy humankind.\\nThe tongue moved gently first, and speech was low,\\nTill wrangling Science taught it noise and show,\\nAnd wicked Wit arose, thy most abusive foe.\\nBut rebel Wit deserts thee oft in vain;\\nLost in the maze of words he turns again,\\nAnd seeks a surer state, and courts thy gentle reign.\\nAfflicted Sense thou kindly dost set free,\\nOppress'd with argumental tyranny,\\nAnd routed Reason finds a safe retreat in thee.\\nWith thee in private modest Dulness lies,\\nAnd in thy bosom lurks in Thought's disguise;\\nThou varnisher of fools, and cheat of all the wise!\\nYet thy indulgence is by both confess'd;\\nFolly by thee lies sleeping in the breast,\\nAnd 'tis in thee at last that Wisdom seeks for rest.\\nSilence! the knave's repute, the whore's good name,\\nThe only honour of the wishing dame;\\nThy very want of tongue makes thee a kind of fame.\\nBut couldst thou seize some tongues that now are free,\\nHow Church and State should be obliged to thee!\\nAt Senate, and at Bar, how welcome would'st thou be!\\nYet Speech even there submissively withdraws\\nFrom rights of subjects, and the poor man's cause:\\nThen pompous Silence reigns, and stills the noisy laws.\\nPast services of friends, good deeds of foes,\\nWhat favourites gain, and what the nation owes,\\nFly the forgetful world, and in thy arms repose.\\nThe country wit, religion of the town,\\nThe courtier's learning, policy o' the gown,\\nAre best by thee express'd, and shine in thee alone.\\nThe parson's cant, the lawyer's sophistry,\\nLord's quibble, critic's jest, all end in thee,\\nAll rest in peace at last, and sleep eternally.\\n\\nThough Artemisia talks, by fits,\\nOf councils, classics, fathers, wits;\\nReads Malebranche, Boyle, and Locke:\\nYet in some things methinks she fails--\\n'Twere well if she would pare her nails,\\nAnd wear a cleaner smock.\\nHaughty and huge as High-Dutch bride,\\nSuch nastiness, and so much pride\\nAre oddly join'd by fate:\\nOn her large squab you find her spread,\\nLike a fat corpse upon a bed,\\nThat lies and stinks in state.\\nShe wears no colours (sign of grace)\\nOn any part except her face;\\nAll white and black beside:\\nDauntless her look, her gesture proud,\\nHer voice theatrically loud,\\nAnd masculine her stride.\\nSo have I seen, in black and white\\nA prating thing, a magpie height,\\nMajestically stalk;\\nA stately, worthless animal,\\nThat plies the tongue, and wags the tail,\\nAll flutter, pride, and talk.\\nPhryne had talents for mankind,\\nOpen she was, and unconfined,\\nLike some free port of trade:\\nMerchants unloaded here their freight,\\nAnd agents from each foreign state\\nHere first their entry made.\\nHer learning and good breeding such,\\nWhether the Italian or the Dutch,\\nSpaniards or French came to her:\\nTo all obliging she'd appear,\\n'Twas 'Si, Signor,' 'twas 'Yaw, Mynheer,'\\n'Twas 'S' il vous plaÃ®t, Monsieur.'\\nObscure by birth, renown'd by crimes,\\nStill changing names, religions, climes,\\nAt length she turns a bride:\\nIn diamonds, pearls, and rich brocades,\\nShe shines the first of batter'd jades,\\nAnd flutters in her pride.\\nSo have I known those insects fair,\\n(Which curious Germans hold so rare)\\nStill vary shapes and dyes;\\nStill gain new titles with new forms;\\nFirst grubs obscene, then wriggling worms,\\nThen painted butterflies.\\n\\nIn that soft season, when descending showers\\nCall forth the greens, and wake the rising flowers;\\nWhen opening buds salute the welcome day,\\nAnd earth relenting feels the genial ray;\\nAs balmy sleep had charm'd my cares to rest,\\nAnd love itself was banish'd from my breast,\\n(What time the morn mysterious visions brings,\\nWhile purer slumbers spread their golden wings),\\nA train of phantoms in wild order rose,\\nAnd, join'd, this intellectual scene compose.\\nI stood, methought, betwixt earth, seas, and skies;\\nThe whole creation open to my eyes:\\nIn air self-balanced hung the globe below,\\nWhere mountains rise and circling oceans flow;\\nHere naked rocks, and empty wastes were seen,\\nThere towery cities, and the forests green:\\nHere sailing ships delight the wandering eyes:\\nThere trees, and intermingled temples rise;\\nNow a clear sun the shining scene displays,\\nThe transient landscape now in clouds decays.\\nO'er the wide prospect, as I gazed around,\\nSudden I heard a wild promiscuous sound,\\nLike broken thunders that at distance roar,\\nOr billows murmuring on the hollow shore:\\nThen gazing up, a glorious pile beheld,\\nWhose towering summit ambient clouds conceal'd.\\nHigh on a rock of ice the structure lay,\\nSteep its ascent, and slippery was the way;\\nThe wondrous rock like Parian marble shone,\\nAnd seem'd, to distant sight, of solid stone.\\nInscriptions here of various names I view'd,\\nThe greater part by hostile time subdued;\\nYet wide was spread their fame in ages past,\\nAnd poets once had promised they should last.\\nSome fresh engraved appear'd of wits renown'd;\\nI look'd again, nor could their trace be found.\\nCritics I saw, that other names deface,\\nAnd fix their own, with labour, in their place:\\nTheir own, like others, soon their place resign'd,\\nOr disappear'd, and left the first behind.\\nNor was the work impair'd by storms alone,\\nBut felt the approaches of too warm a sun;\\nFor Fame, impatient of extremes, decays\\nNot more by envy than excess of praise.\\nYet part no injuries of heaven could feel,\\nLike crystal faithful to the graving steel:\\nThe rock's high summit, in the temple's shade,\\nNor heat could melt, nor beating storm invade.\\nTheir names inscribed unnumber'd ages past\\nFrom time's first birth, with time itself shall last;\\nThese ever new, nor subject to decays,\\nSpread, and grow brighter with the length of days.\\nSo Zembla's rocks (the beauteous work of frost)\\nRise white in air, and glitter o'er the coast;\\nPale suns, unfelt, at distance roll away,\\nAnd on the impassive ice the lightnings play;\\nEternal snows the growing mass supply,\\nTill the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky:\\nAs Atlas fix'd, each hoary pile appears,\\nThe gather'd winter of a thousand years.\\nOn this foundation Fame's high temple stands.\\nStupendous pile! not rear'd by mortal hands.\\nWhate'er proud Rome or artful Greece beheld,\\nOr elder Babylon, its frame excell'd.\\nFour faces had the dome, and every face\\nOf various structure, but of equal grace;\\nFour brazen gates, on columns lifted high,\\nSalute the different quarters of the sky.\\nHere fabled chiefs in darker ages born,\\nOr worthies old, whom arms or arts adorn,\\nWho cities raised, or tamed a monstrous race,\\nThe walls in venerable order grace;\\nHeroes in animated marble frown,\\nAnd legislators seem to think in stone.\\nWestward, a sumptuous frontispiece appear'd,\\nOn Doric pillars of white marble rear'd,\\nCrown'd with an architrave of antique mould,\\nAnd sculpture rising on the roughen'd gold.\\nIn shaggy spoils here Theseus was beheld,\\nAnd Perseus dreadful with Minerva's shield:\\nThere great Alcides stooping with his toil,\\nRests on his club, and holds th' Hesperian spoil.\\nHere Orpheus sings; trees, moving to the sound,\\nStart from their roots, and form a shade around;\\nAmphion there the loud creating lyre\\nStrikes, and behold a sudden Thebes aspire!\\nCythÃ¦ron's echoes answer to his call,\\nAnd half the mountain rolls into a wall:\\nThere might you see the lengthening spires ascend,\\nThe domes swell up, the widening arches bend,\\nThe growing towers, like exhalations rise,\\nAnd the huge columns heave into the skies.\\nThe eastern front was glorious to behold,\\nWith diamond flaming, and barbaric gold.\\nThere Ninus shone, who spread the Assyrian fame,\\nAnd the great founder of the Persian name:\\nThere in long robes the royal Magi stand,\\nGrave Zoroaster waves the circling wand,\\nThe sage Chaldeans robed in white appear'd,\\nAnd Brachmans, deep in desert woods revered.\\nThese stopp'd the moon, and call'd the unbodied shades\\nTo midnight banquets in the glimmering glades;\\nMade visionary fabrics round them rise,\\nAnd airy spectres skim before their eyes;\\nOf talismans and sigils knew the power,\\nAnd careful watch'd the planetary hour.\\nSuperior, and alone, Confucius stood,\\nWho taught that useful science--to be good.\\nBut on the south, a long majestic race\\nOf Egypt's priests the gilded niches grace,\\nWho measured earth, described the starry spheres,\\nAnd traced the long records of lunar years.\\nHigh on his car Sesostris struck my view,\\nWhom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew:\\nHis hands a bow and pointed javelin hold;\\nHis giant limbs are arm'd in scales of gold.\\nBetween the statues obelisks were placed,\\nAnd the learn'd walls with hieroglyphics graced.\\nOf Gothic structure was the northern side,\\nO'erwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride.\\nThere huge Colosses rose, with trophies crown'd,\\nAnd Runic characters were graved around.\\nThere sat Zamolxis with erected eyes,\\nAnd Odin here in mimic trances dies.\\nThere on rude iron columns, smear'd with blood,\\nThe horrid forms of Seythian heroes stood,\\nDruids and Bards (their once loud harps unstrung)\\nAnd youths that died to be by poets sung.\\nThese, and a thousand more of doubtful fame,\\nTo whom old fables gave a lasting name,\\nIn ranks adorn'd the temple's outward face;\\nThe wall, in lustre and effect like glass,\\nWhich o'er each object casting various dyes,\\nEnlarges some, and others multiplies:\\nNor void of emblem was the mystic wall,\\nFor thus romantic Fame increases all.\\nThe temple shakes, the sounding gates unfold\\nWide vaults appear, and roofs of fretted gold:\\nRaised on a thousand pillars, wreathed around\\nWith laurel foliage, and with eagles crown'd:\\nOf bright, transparent beryl were the walls,\\nThe friezes gold, and gold the capitals:\\nAs heaven with stars, the roof with jewels glows,\\nAnd ever-living lamps depend in rows.\\nFull in the passage of each spacious gate,\\nThe sage historians in white garments wait;\\nGraved o'er their seats the form of Time was found,\\nHis scythe reversed, and both his pinions bound.\\nWithin stood heroes, who through loud alarms\\nIn bloody fields pursued renown in arms.\\nHigh on a throne, with trophies charged, I view'd\\nThe youth that all things but himself subdued;\\nHis feet on sceptres and tiaras trod,\\nAnd his horn'd head belied the Libyan god.\\nThere CÃ¦sar, graced with both Minervas, shone;\\nCÃ¦sar, the world's great master, and his own;\\nUnmoved, superior still in every state,\\nAnd scarce detested in his country's fate.\\nBut chief were those, who not for empire fought,\\nBut with their toils their people's safety bought:\\nHigh o'er the rest Epaminondas stood;\\nTimoleon, glorious in his brother's blood;\\nBold Scipio, saviour of the Roman state;\\nGreat in his triumphs, in retirement great;\\nAnd wise Aurelius, in whose well-taught mind,\\nWith boundless power unbounded virtue join'd,\\nHis own strict judge, and patron of mankind.\\nMuch-suffering heroes next their honours claim,\\nThose of less noisy, and less guilty fame,\\nFair Virtue's silent train: supreme of these\\nHere ever shines the godlike Socrates:\\nHe whom ungrateful Athens could expel,\\nAt all times just, but when he sign'd the shell:\\nHere his abode the martyr'd Phocion claims,\\nWith Agis, not the last of Spartan names:\\nUnconquer'd Cato shows the wound he tore,\\nAnd Brutus his ill Genius meets no more.\\nBut in the centre of the hallow'd choir,\\nSix pompous columns o'er the rest aspire;\\nAround the shrine itself of Fame they stand,\\nHold the chief honours, and the fane command.\\nHigh on the first, the mighty Homer shone;\\nEternal adamant composed his throne;\\nFather of verse! in holy fillets dress'd,\\nHis silver beard waved gently o'er his breast;\\nThough blind, a boldness in his looks appears;\\nIn years he seem'd, but not impair'd by years.\\nThe wars of Troy were round the pillar seen:\\nHere fierce Tydides wounds the Cyprian Queen;\\nHere Hector, glorious from Patroclus' fall,\\nHere dragg'd in triumph round the Trojan wall:\\nMotion and life did every part inspire,\\nBold was the work, and proved the master's fire;\\nA strong expression most he seem'd to affect,\\nAnd here and there disclosed a brave neglect.\\nA golden column next in rank appear'd,\\nOn which a shrine of purest gold was rear'd;\\nFinish'd the whole, and labour'd every part,\\nWith patient touches of unwearied art:\\nThe Mantuan there in sober triumph sate,\\nComposed his posture, and his look sedate;\\nOn Homer still he fix'd a reverend eye,\\nGreat without pride, in modest majesty.\\nIn living sculpture on the sides were spread\\nThe Latian wars, and haughty Turnus dead;\\nEliza stretch'd upon the funeral pyre,\\nÃ†neas bending with his aged sire:\\nTroy flamed in burning gold, and o'er the throne,\\nARMS AND THE MAN in golden cyphers shone.\\nFour swans sustain a car of silver bright,\\nWith heads advanced, and pinions stretch'd for flight:\\nHere, like some furious prophet, Pindar rode,\\nAnd seem'd to labour with the inspiring god.\\nAcross the harp a careless hand he flings,\\nAnd boldly sinks into the sounding strings.\\nThe figured games of Greece the column grace,\\nNeptune and Jove survey the rapid race.\\nThe youths hang o'er their chariots as they run;\\nThe fiery steeds seem starting from the stone;\\nThe champions in distorted postures threat;\\nAnd all appear'd irregularly great.\\nHere happy Horace tuned the Ausonian lyre\\nTo sweeter sounds, and temper'd Pindar's fire:\\nPleased with AlcÃ¦us' manly rage t' infuse\\nThe softer spirit of the Sapphic Muse.\\nThe polish'd pillar different sculptures grace;\\nA work outlasting monumental brass.\\nHere smiling Loves and Bacchanals appear,\\nThe Julian star, and great Augustus here;\\nThe doves that round the infant poet spread\\nMyrtles and bays, hung hovering o'er his head.\\nHere in a shrine that cast a dazzling light,\\nSat, fix'd in thought, the mighty Stagyrite;\\nHis sacred head a radiant zodiac crown'd,\\nAnd various animals his side surround;\\nHis piercing eyes, erect, appear to view\\nSuperior worlds, and look all Nature through.\\nWith equal rays immortal Tully shone,\\nThe Roman rostra deck'd the Consul's throne:\\nGathering his flowing robe, he seem'd to stand\\nIn act to speak, and graceful stretch'd his hand.\\nBehind, Rome's Genius waits with civic crowns,\\nAnd the great Father of his country owns.\\nThese massy columns in a circle rise,\\nO'er which a pompous dome invades the skies:\\nScarce to the top I stretch'd my aching sight,\\nSo large it spread, and swell'd to such a height.\\nFull in the midst, proud Fame's imperial seat\\nWith jewels blazed, magnificently great;\\nThe vivid emeralds there revive the eye,\\nThe flaming rubies show their sanguine dye,\\nBright azure rays from lively sapphires stream,\\nAnd lucid amber casts a golden gleam.\\nWith various-colour'd light the pavement shone,\\nAnd all on fire appear'd the glowing throne;\\nThe dome's high arch reflects the mingled blaze,\\nAnd forms a rainbow of alternate rays.\\nWhen on the goddess first I cast my sight,\\nScarce seem'd her stature of a cubit's height;\\nBut swell'd to larger size, the more I gazed,\\nTill to the roof her towering front she raised.\\nWith her, the temple every moment grew,\\nAnd ampler vistas open'd to my view:\\nUpward the columns shoot, the roofs ascend,\\nAnd arches widen, and long aisles extend.\\nSuch was her form as ancient bards have told,\\nWings raise her arms, and wings her feet infold;\\nA thousand busy tongues the goddess bears,\\nA thousand open eyes, and thousand listening ears.\\nBeneath, in order ranged, the tuneful Nine\\n(Her virgin handmaids) still attend the shrine:\\nWith eyes on Fame for ever fix'd, they sing;\\nFor Fame they raise the voice, and tune the string;\\nWith Time's first birth began the heavenly lays,\\nAnd last, eternal, through the length of days.\\nAround these wonders as I cast a look,\\nThe trumpet sounded, and the temple shook,\\nAnd all the nations, summon'd at the call,\\nFrom different quarters fill the crowded hall:\\nOf various tongues the mingled sounds were heard\\nIn various garbs promiscuous throngs appear'd;\\nThick as the bees, that with the spring renew\\nTheir flowery toils, and sip the fragrant dew,\\nWhen the wing'd colonies first tempt the sky,\\nO'er dusky fields and shaded waters fly,\\nOr settling, seize the sweets the blossoms yield,\\nAnd a low murmur runs along the field.\\nMillions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend,\\nAnd all degrees before the goddess bend;\\nThe poor, the rich, the valiant, and the sage,\\nAnd boasting youth, and narrative old age.\\nTheir pleas were different, their request the same:\\nFor good and bad alike are fond of Fame.\\nSome she disgraced, and some with honours crown'd;\\nUnlike successes equal merits found.\\nThus her blind sister, fickle Fortune, reigns,\\nAnd, undiscerning, scatters crowns and chains.\\nFirst at the shrine the learnÃ¨d world appear,\\nAnd to the goddess thus prefer their prayer:\\n'Long have we sought to instruct and please mankind,\\nWith studies pale, with midnight vigils blind;\\nBut thank'd by few, rewarded yet by none,\\nWe here appeal to thy superior throne;\\nOn wit and learning the just prize bestow,\\nFor fame is all we must expect below.'\\nThe goddess heard, and bade the Muses raise\\nThe golden trumpet of eternal praise:\\nFrom pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound,\\nThat fills the circuit of the world around;\\nNot all at once, as thunder breaks the cloud;\\nThe notes at first were rather sweet than loud:\\nBy just degrees they every moment rise,\\nFill the wide earth, and gain upon the skies.\\nAt every breath were balmy odours shed,\\nWhich still grew sweeter as they wider spread;\\nLess fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales,\\nOr spices breathing in Arabian gales.\\nNext these, the good and just, an awful train,\\nThus on their knees address the sacred fane:\\n'Since living virtue is with envy cursed,\\nAnd the best men are treated like the worst,\\nDo thou, just goddess, call our merits forth,\\nAnd give each deed the exact intrinsic worth.'\\n'Not with bare justice shall your act be crown'd,'\\n(Said Fame), 'but high above desert renown'd:\\nLet fuller notes the applauding world amaze,\\nAnd the loud clarion labour in your praise.'\\nThis band dismiss'd, behold, another crowd\\nPreferr'd the same request, and lowly bow'd;\\nThe constant tenor of whose well-spent days\\nNo less deserved a just return of praise.\\nBut straight the direful trump of Slander sounds;\\nThrough the big dome the doubling thunder bounds;\\nLoud as the burst of cannon rends the skies,\\nThe dire report through every region flies,\\nIn every ear incessant rumours rung,\\nAnd gathering scandals grew on every tongue.\\nFrom the black trumpet's rusty concave broke\\nSulphureous flames, and clouds of rolling smoke:\\nThe poisonous vapour blots the purple skies,\\nAnd withers all before it as it flies.\\nA troop came next, who crowns and armour wore,\\nAnd proud defiance in their looks they bore:\\n'For thee' (they cried), 'amidst alarms and strife,\\nWe sail'd in tempests down the stream of life;\\nFor thee whole nations fill'd with flames and blood,\\nAnd swam to empire through the purple flood.\\nThose ills we dared, thy inspiration own,\\nWhat virtue seem'd, was done for thee alone.'\\n'Ambitious fools!' (the Queen replied, and frown'd)\\n'Be all your acts in dark oblivion drown'd;\\nThere sleep forgot, with mighty tyrants gone,\\nYour statues moulder'd, and your names unknown!'\\nA sudden cloud straight snatch'd them from my sight,\\nAnd each majestic phantom sunk in night.\\nThen came the smallest tribe I yet had seen;\\nPlain was their dress, and modest was their mien.\\n'Great idol of mankind! we neither claim\\nThe praise of merit, nor aspire to fame;\\nBut safe in deserts from the applause of men,\\nWould die unheard of, as we lived unseen;\\n'Tis all we beg thee, to conceal from sight\\nThose acts of goodness which themselves requite.\\nOh let us still the secret joy partake,\\nTo follow virtue even for virtue's sake.'\\n'And live there men, who slight immortal Fame?\\nWho then with incense shall adore our name?\\nBut, mortals! know, 'tis still our greatest pride\\nTo blaze those virtues which the good would hide.\\nRise, Muses, rise! add all your tuneful breath;\\nThese must not sleep in darkness and in death.'\\nShe said: in air the trembling music floats,\\nAnd on the winds triumphant swell the notes;\\nSo soft, though high, so loud, and yet so clear,\\nEven listening angels lean'd from heaven to hear:\\nTo furthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies,\\nSweet to the world, and grateful to the skies.\\nNext these a youthful train their vows express'd,\\nWith feathers crown'd, with gay embroidery dress'd:\\n'Hither' (they cried) 'direct your eyes, and see\\nThe men of pleasure, dress, and gallantry;\\nOurs is the place at banquets, balls, and plays,\\nSprightly our nights, polite are all our days;\\nCourts we frequent, where 'tis our pleasing care\\nTo pay due visits, and address the fair:\\nIn fact, 'tis true, no nymph we could persuade,\\nBut still in fancy vanquish'd every maid;\\nOf unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell,\\nYet, would the world believe us, all were well.\\nThe joy let others have, and we the name,\\nAnd what we want in pleasure, grant in fame.'\\nThe Queen assents, the trumpet rends the skies,\\nAnd at each blast a lady's honour dies.\\nPleased with the strange success, vast numbers press'd\\nAround the shrine, and made the same request:\\n'What! you,' (she cried) 'unlearn'd in arts to please,\\nSlaves to yourselves, and even fatigued with ease,\\nWho lose a length of undeserving days,\\nWould you usurp the lover's dear-bought praise?\\nTo just contempt, ye vain pretenders, fall,\\nThe people's fable and the scorn of all.'\\nStraight the black clarion sends a horrid sound,\", \"Loud laughs burst out, and bitter scoffs fly round,\\nWhispers are heard, with taunts reviling loud,\\nAnd scornful hisses run through all the crowd.\\nLast, those who boast of mighty mischiefs done,\\nEnslave their country, or usurp a throne;\\nOr who their glory's dire foundation laid\\nOn sovereigns ruin'd, or on friends betray'd;\\nCalm, thinking villains, whom no faith could fix,\\nOf crooked counsels, and dark politics;\\nOf these a gloomy tribe surround the throne,\\nAnd beg to make the immortal treasons known.\\nThe trumpet roars, long flaky flames expire,\\nWith sparks, that seem'd to set the world on fire.\\nAt the dread sound, pale mortals stood aghast,\\nAnd startled Nature trembled with the blast.\\nThis having heard and seen, some Power unknown\\nStraight changed the scene, and snatch'd me from the throne.\\nBefore my view appear'd a structure fair,\\nIts site uncertain, if in earth or air;\\nWith rapid motion turn'd the mansion round;\\nWith ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound;\\nNot less in number were the spacious doors,\\nThan leaves on trees, or sands upon the shores;\\nWhich still unfolded stand, by night, by day,\\nPervious to winds, and open every way.\\nAs flames by nature to the skies ascend,\\nAs weighty bodies to the centre tend,\\nAs to the sea returning rivers roll,\\nAnd the touch'd needle trembles to the pole;\\nHither, as to their proper place, arise\\nAll various sounds from earth, and seas, and skies,\\nOr spoke aloud, or whisper'd in the ear;\\nNor ever silence, rest, or peace is here.\\nAs on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes\\nThe sinking stone at first a circle makes;\\nThe trembling surface by the motion stirr'd,\\nSpreads in a second circle, then a third;\\nWide, and more wide, the floating rings advance,\\nFill all the watery plain, and to the margin dance:\\nThus every voice and sound, when first they break,\\nOn neighbouring air a soft impression make;\\nAnother ambient circle then they move;\\nThat, in its turn, impels the next above;\\nThrough undulating air the sounds are sent,\\nAnd spread o'er all the fluid element.\\nThere various news I heard of love and strife,\\nOf peace and war, health, sickness, death, and life,\\nOf loss and gain, of famine and of store,\\nOf storms at sea, and travels on the shore,\\nOf prodigies, and portents seen in air,\\nOf fires and plagues, and stars with blazing hair,\\nOf turns of fortune, changes in the state,\\nThe falls of favourites, projects of the great,\\nOf old mismanagements, taxations new:\\nAll neither wholly false, nor wholly true.\\nAbove, below, without, within, around,\\nConfused, unnumber'd multitudes are found,\\nWho pass, repass, advance, and glide away;\\nHosts raised by fear, and phantoms of a day:\\nAstrologers, that future fates foreshow;\\nProjectors, quacks, and lawyers not a few;\\nAnd priests, and party-zealots, numerous bands\\nWith home-born lies, or tales from foreign lands;\\nEach talk'd aloud, or in some secret place,\\nAnd wild impatience stared in every face.\\nThe flying rumours gather'd as they roll'd,\\nScarce any tale was sooner heard than told;\\nAnd all who told it added something new,\\nAnd all who heard it made enlargements too,\\nIn every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew.\\nThus flying east and west, and north and south,\\nNews travell'd with increase from mouth to mouth.\\nSo from a spark, that kindled first by chance,\\nWith gathering force the quickening flames advance;\\nTill to the clouds their curling heads aspire,\\nAnd towers and temples sink in floods of fire.\\nWhen thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung,\\nFull grown, and fit to grace a mortal tongue,\\nThrough thousand vents, impatient, forth they flow,\\nAnd rush in millions on the world below.\\nFame sits aloft, and points them out their course,\\nTheir date determines, and prescribes their force:\\nSome to remain, and some to perish soon;\\nOr wane and wax alternate like the moon.\\nAround, a thousand wingÃ¨d wonders fly,\\nBorn by the trumpet's blast, and scatter'd through the sky.\\nThere, at one passage, oft you might survey\\nA lie and truth contending for the way;\\nAnd long 'twas doubtful, both so closely pent,\\nWhich first should issue through the narrow vent:\\nAt last agreed, together out they fly,\\nInseparable now, the truth and lie;\\nThe strict companions are for ever join'd,\\nAnd this or that unmix'd, no mortal e'er shall find.\\nWhile thus I stood, intent to see and hear,\\nOne came, methought, and whisper'd in my ear:\\n'What could thus high thy rash ambition raise?\\nArt thou, fond youth, a candidate for praise?'\\n''Tis true,' said I, 'not void of hopes I came,\\nFor who so fond as youthful bards of fame?\\nBut few, alas! the casual blessing boast,\\nSo hard to gain, so easy to be lost.\\nHow vain that second life in others' breath,\\nThe estate which wits inherit after death!\\nEase, health, and life, for this they must resign,\\n(Unsure the tenure, but how vast the fine!)\\nThe great man's curse, without the gains, endure,\\nBe envied, wretched, and be flatter'd, poor;\\nAll luckless wits their enemies profess'd,\\nAnd all successful, jealous friends at best.\\nNor Fame I slight, nor for her favours call;\\nShe comes unlook'd for, if she comes at all.\\nBut if the purchase costs so dear a price,\\nAs soothing folly, or exalting vice;\\nOh! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway,\\nAnd follow still where fortune leads the way;\\nOr if no basis bear my rising name,\\nBut the fallen ruins of another's fame;\\nThen teach me, Heaven! to scorn the guilty bays,\\nDrive from my breast that wretched lust of praise,\\nUnblemish'd let me live, or die unknown;\\nOh, grant an honest fame, or grant me none!'\\n\\nIn these deep solitudes and awful cells,\\nWhere heavenly-pensive Contemplation dwells,\\nAnd ever-musing Melancholy reigns,\\nWhat means this tumult in a vestal's veins?\\nWhy rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?\\nWhy feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?\\nYet, yet I love!--From Abelard it came,\\nAnd Eloisa yet must kiss the name.\\nDear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,\\nNor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd:\\nHide it, my heart, within that close disguise\\nWhere, mix'd with God's, his loved idea lies:\\nOh write it not, my hand!--the name appears\\nAlready written--wash it out, my tears!\\nIn vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,\\nHer heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.\\nRelentless walls! whose darksome round contains\\nRepentant sighs, and voluntary pains:\\nYe rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;\\nYe grots and caverns, shagg'd with horrid thorn!\\nShrines! where their vigils pale-eyed virgins keep,\\nAnd pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!\\nThough cold like you, unmoved and silent grown,\\nI have not yet forgot myself to stone.\\nAll is not Heaven's while Abelard has part,\\nStill rebel nature holds out half my heart;\\nNor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,\\nNor tears for ages taught to flow in vain.\\nSoon as thy letters trembling I unclose,\\nThat well-known name awakens all my woes.\\nOh, name for ever sad! for ever dear!\\nStill breathed in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.\\nI tremble too, where'er my own I find,\\nSome dire misfortune follows close behind.\\nLine after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,\\nLed through a sad variety of woe;\\nNow warm in love, now withering in my bloom,\\nLost in a convent's solitary gloom!\\nThere stern religion quench'd the unwilling flame,\\nThere died the best of passions, Love and Fame.\\nYet write, oh! write me all, that I may join\\nGriefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.\\nNor foes nor fortune take this power away;\\nAnd is my Abelard less kind than they?\\nTears still are mine, and those I need not spare,\\nLove but demands what else were shed in prayer;\\nNo happier task these faded eyes pursue;\\nTo read and weep is all they now can do.\\nThen share thy pain, allow that sad relief;\\nAh, more than share it, give me all thy grief!\\nHeaven first taught letters for some wretch's aid,\\nSome banish'd lover, or some captive maid;\\nThey live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,\\nWarm from the soul, and faithful to its fires;\\nThe virgin's wish without her fears impart,\\nExcuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,\\nSpeed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,\\nAnd waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.\\nThou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,\\nWhen Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;\\nMy fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,\\nSome emanation of the all-beauteous Mind.\\nThose smiling eyes, attempering every ray,\\nShone sweetly lambent with celestial day.\\nGuiltless I gazed; Heaven listen'd while you sung;\\nAnd truths divine came mended from that tongue.\\nFrom lips like those, what precept fail'd to move?\\nToo soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love:\\nBack through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,\\nNor wish'd an angel whom I loved a man.\\nDim and remote the joys of saints I see;\\nNor envy them that heaven I lose for thee.\\nHow oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,\\nCurse on all laws but those which Love has made!\\nLove, free as air, at sight of human ties,\\nSpreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.\\nLet wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,\\nAugust her deed, and sacred be her fame;\\nBefore true passion all those views remove;\\nFame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?\\nThe jealous god, when we profane his fires,\\nThose restless passions in revenge inspires,\\nAnd bids them make mistaken mortals groan,\\nWho seek in love for aught but love alone.\\nShould at my feet the world's great master fall,\\nHimself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn them all:\\nNot CÃ¦sar's empress would I deign to prove;\\nNo, make me mistress to the man I love;\\nIf there be yet another name more free,\\nMore fond than mistress, make me that to thee!\\nOh, happy state! when souls each other draw,\\nWhen love is liberty, and nature law:\\nAll then is full, possessing and possess'd,\\nNo craving void left aching in the breast:\\nEven thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,\\nAnd each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.\\nThis, sure, is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)\\nAnd once the lot of Abelard and me.\\nAlas, how changed! what sudden horrors rise!\\nA naked lover bound and bleeding lies!\\nWhere, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,\\nHer poniard, had opposed the dire command.\\nBarbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;\\nThe crime was common, common be the pain.\\nI can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,\\nLet tears and burning blushes speak the rest.\\nCanst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,\\nWhen victims at yon altar's foot we lay?\\nCanst thou forget what tears that moment fell,\\nWhen, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?\\nAs with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,\\nThe shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale:\\nHeaven scarce believed the conquest it survey'd,\\nAnd saints with wonder heard the vows I made.\\nYet then, to those dread altars as I drew,\\nNot on the cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:\\nNot grace, or zeal, love only was my call,\\nAnd if I lose thy love, I lose my all.\\nCome! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;\\nThose still at least are left thee to bestow.\\nStill on that breast enamour'd let me lie,\\nStill drink delicious poison from thy eye,\\nPant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;\\nGive all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.\\nAh, no! instruct me other joys to prize,\\nWith other beauties charm my partial eyes,\\nFull in my view set all the bright abode,\\nAnd make my soul quit Abelard for God.\\nAh, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,\\nPlants of thy hand, and children of thy prayer.\\nFrom the false world in early youth they fled,\\nBy thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.\\nYou raised these hallow'd walls; the desert smiled,\\nAnd Paradise was open'd in the wild.\\nNo weeping orphan saw his father's stores\\nOur shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;\\nNo silver saints, by dying misers given,\\nHere bribed the rage of ill-requited Heaven:\\nBut such plain roofs as Piety could raise,\\nAnd only vocal with the Maker's praise.\\nIn these lone walls, (their day's eternal bound)\\nThese moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,\\nWhere awful arches make a noonday night,\\nAnd the dim windows shed a solemn light;\\nThy eyes diffused a reconciling ray,\\nAnd gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.\\nBut now no face divine contentment wears,\\n'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.\\nSee how the force of others' prayers I try,\\n(Oh pious fraud of amorous charity!)\\nBut why should I on others' prayers depend?\\nCome thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!\\nAh, let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,\\nAnd all those tender names in one--thy love!\\nThe darksome pines that, o'er yon rocks reclined,\\nWave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,\\nThe wandering streams that shine between the hills,\\nThe grots that echo to the tinkling rills,\\nThe dying gales that pant upon the trees,\\nThe lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;\\nNo more these scenes my meditation aid,\\nOr lull to rest the visionary maid.\\nBut o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,\\nLong-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,\\nBlack Melancholy sits, and round her throws\\nA death-like silence, and a dread repose:\\nHer gloomy presence saddens all the scene,\\nShades every flower, and darkens every green,\\nDeepens the murmur of the falling floods,\\nAnd breathes a browner horror on the woods.\\nYet here for ever, ever must I stay;\\nSad proof how well a lover can obey!\\nDeath, only death, can break the lasting chain;\\nAnd here, even then, shall my cold dust remain;\\nHere all its frailties, all its flames resign,\\nAnd wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.\\nAh, wretch! believed the spouse of God in vain,\\nConfess'd within the slave of love and man.\\nAssist me, Heaven! but whence arose that prayer?\\nSprung it from piety, or from despair?\\nEven here, where frozen chastity retires,\\nLove finds an altar for forbidden fires.\\nI ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;\\nI mourn the lover, not lament the fault;\\nI view my crime, but kindle at the view,\\nRepent old pleasures, and solicit new;\\nNow turn'd to Heaven, I weep my past offence,\\nNow think of thee, and curse my innocence.\\nOf all affliction taught a lover yet,\\n'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!\\nHow shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,\\nAnd love the offender, yet detest the offence?\\nHow the dear object from the crime remove,\\nOr how distinguish penitence from love?\\nUnequal task! a passion to resign,\\nFor hearts so touch'd, so pierced, so lost as mine.\\nEre such a soul regains its peaceful state,\\nHow often must it love, how often hate!\\nHow often hope, despair, resent, regret,\\nConceal, disdain,--do all things but forget!\\nBut let Heaven seize it, all at once 'tis fired;\\nNot touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspired!\\nOh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,\\nRenounce my love, my life, myself--and you.\\nFill my fond heart with God alone, for He\\nAlone can rival, can succeed to thee.\\nHow happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!\\nThe world forgetting, by the world forgot:\\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\\nEach prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd;\\nLabour and rest, that equal periods keep;\\n'Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;'\\nDesires composed, affections ever even;\\nTears that delight, and sighs that waft to heaven.\\nGrace shines around her with serenest beams,\\nAnd whispering angels prompt her golden dreams.\\nFor her the unfading rose of Eden blooms,\\nAnd wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes;\\nFor her the spouse prepares the bridal ring,\\nFor her white virgins hymeneals sing,\\nTo sounds of heavenly harps she dies away,\\nAnd melts in visions of eternal day.\\nFar other dreams my erring soul employ,\\nFar other raptures, of unholy joy:\\nWhen at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,\\nFancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,\\nThen conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,\\nAll my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.\\nO curst, dear horrors of all-conscious night!\\nHow glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!\\nProvoking demons all restraint remove,\\nAnd stir within me every source of love.\\nI hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,\\nAnd round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.\\nI wake:--no more I hear, no more I view,\\nThe phantom flies me, as unkind as you.\\nI call aloud; it hears not what I say:\\nI stretch my empty arms; it glides away.\\nTo dream once more I close my willing eyes;\\nYe soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!\\nAlas, no more! methinks we wandering go\\nThrough dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,\\nWhere round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps,\\nAnd low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.\\nSudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;\\nClouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.\\nI shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,\\nAnd wake to all the griefs I left behind.\\nFor thee the Fates, severely kind, ordain\\nA cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;\\nThy life a long dead calm of fix'd repose;\\nNo pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.\\nStill as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,\\nOr moving spirit bade the waters flow;\\nSoft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven,\\nAnd mild as opening gleams of promised heaven.\\nCome, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?\\nThe torch of Venus burns not for the dead.\\nNature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;\\nEven thou art cold--yet Eloisa loves.\\nAh hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn\\nTo light the dead, and warm the unfruitful urn.\\nWhat scenes appear where'er I turn my view?\\nThe dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,\\nRise in the grove, before the altar rise,\\nStain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.\\nI waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,\\nThy image steals between my God and me,\\nThy voice I seem in every hymn to hear,\\nWith every bead I drop too soft a tear.\\nWhen from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,\\nAnd swelling organs lift the rising soul,\\nOne thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,\\nPriests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:\\nIn seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,\\nWhile altars blaze, and angels tremble round.\\nWhile prostrate here in humble grief I lie,\\nKind, virtuous drops just gathering in my eye,\\nWhile praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,\\nAnd dawning grace is opening on my soul:\\nCome, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!\\nOppose thyself to heaven; dispute my heart;\\nCome, with one glance of those deluding eyes\\nBlot out each bright idea of the skies;\\nTake back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;\\nTake back my fruitless penitence and prayers;\\nSnatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;\\nAssist the fiends, and tear me from my God!\\nNo, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;\\nRise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!\\nAh, come not, write not, think not once of me,\\nNor share one pang of all I felt for thee!\\nThy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;\\nForget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.\\nFair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view)\\nLong loved, adored ideas, all adieu!\\nO Grace serene! O Virtue heavenly fair!\\nDivine oblivion of low-thoughted care!\\nFresh blooming Hope, gay daughter of the sky!\\nAnd Faith, our early immortality!\\nEnter, each mild, each amicable guest;\\nReceive, and wrap me in eternal rest!\\nSee in her cell sad Eloisa spread,\\nPropp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.\\nIn each low wind methinks a spirit calls,\\nAnd more than echoes talk along the walls.\\nHere, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,\\nFrom yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.\\n'Come, sister, come!' (it said, or seem'd to say)\\n'Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!\\nOnce like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,\\nLove's victim then, though now a sainted maid:\\nBut all is calm in this eternal sleep;\\nHere Grief forgets to groan, and Love to weep,\\nEven Superstition loses every fear:\\nFor God, not man, absolves our frailties here.'\\nI come, I come! prepare your roseate bowers,\\nCelestial palms, and ever-blooming flowers.\\nThither, where sinners may have rest, I go,\\nWhere flames refined in breasts seraphic glow:\\nThou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,\\nAnd smooth my passage to the realms of day;\\nSee my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll,\\nSuck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!\\nAh, no!--in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,\\nThe hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,\\nPresent the cross before my lifted eye,\\nTeach me at once, and learn of me to die.\\nAh, then thy once-loved Eloisa see!\\nIt will be then no crime to gaze on me.\\nSee from my cheek the transient roses fly!\\nSee the last sparkle languish in my eye!\\nTill every motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;\\nAnd even my Abelard be loved no more.\\nO Death all-eloquent! you only prove\\nWhat dust we doat on when 'tis man we love.\\nThen too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,\\n(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy!)\\nIn trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,\\nBright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,\\nFrom opening skies may streaming glories shine,\\nAnd saints embrace thee with a love like mine.\\nMay one kind grave unite each hapless name,\\nAnd graft my love immortal on thy fame!\\nThen, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,\\nWhen this rebellious heart shall beat no more;\\nIf ever chance two wandering lovers brings\\nTo Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,\\nO'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,\\nAnd drink the falling tears each other sheds;\\nThen sadly say,--with mutual pity moved,\\n'Oh, may we never love as these have loved!'\\nFrom the full choir when loud hosannas rise,\\nAnd swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,\\nAmid that scene, if some relenting eye\\nGlance on the stone where our cold relics lie,\\nDevotion's self shall steal a thought from heaven,\\nOne human tear shall drop, and be forgiven.\\nAnd sure, if Fate some future bard shall join\\nIn sad similitude of griefs to mine,\\nCondemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,\\nAnd image charms he must behold no more;\\nSuch if there be, who love so long, so well,\\nLet him our sad, our tender story tell;\\nThe well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;\\nHe best can paint them who shall feel them most.\\n\\nSuch were the notes thy once-loved Poet sung,\\nTill Death untimely stopp'd his tuneful tongue.\\nOh just beheld and lost! admired and mourn'd!\\nWith softest manners, gentlest arts adorn'd!\\nBlest in each science, blest in every strain!\\nDear to the Muse! to Harley dear--in vain!\\nFor him, thou oft hast bid the world attend,\\nFond to forget the statesman in the friend;\\nFor Swift and him, despised the farce of state,\\nThe sober follies of the wise and great;\\nDext'rous, the craving, fawning crowd to quit,\\nAnd pleased to 'scape from Flattery to Wit.\\nAbsent or dead, still let a friend be dear,\\n(A sigh the absent claims, the dead a tear,)\\nRecall those nights that closed thy toilsome days,\\nStill hear thy Parnell in his living lays,\\nWho, careless now of interest, fame, or fate,\\nPerhaps forgets that Oxford e'er was great;\\nOr deeming meanest what we greatest call,\\nBehold thee glorious only in thy fall.\\nAnd sure, if aught below the seats divine\\nCan touch immortals, 'tis a soul like thine:\\nA soul supreme, in each hard instance tried,\\nAbove all pain, all passion, and all pride,\\nThe rage of power, the blast of public breath,\\nThe lust of lucre, and the dread of death.\\nIn vain to deserts thy retreat is made;\\nThe Muse attends thee to thy silent shade:\\n'Tis hers the brave man's latest steps to trace,\\nRejudge his acts, and dignify disgrace.\\nWhen interest calls off all her sneaking train,\\nAnd all the obliged desert, and all the vain,\\nShe waits, or to the scaffold, or the cell,\\nWhen the last lingering friend has bid farewell.\\nEven now she shades thy evening-walk with bays,\\n(No hireling she, no prostitute to praise),\\nEven now, observant of the parting ray,\\nEyes the calm sunset of thy various day;\\nThrough Fortune's cloud one truly great can see,\\nNor fears to tell that Mortimer is he.\\n\\nThis verse be thine, my friend, nor thou refuse\\nThis from no venal or ungrateful Muse.\\nWhether thy hand strike out some free design,\\nWhere life awakes, and dawns at every line;\\nOr blend in beauteous tints the colour'd mass,\\nAnd from the canvas call the mimic face:\\nRead these instructive leaves, in which conspire\\nFresnoy's close art, and Dryden's native fire:\\nAnd, reading, wish like theirs our fate and fame,\\nSo mix'd our studies, and so join'd our name;\\nLike them to shine through long succeeding age,\\nSo just thy skill, so regular my rage.\\nSmit with the love of sister-arts we came,\\nAnd met congenial, mingling flame with flame;\\nLike friendly colours found them both unite,\\nAnd each from each contract new strength and light.\\nHow oft in pleasing tasks we wear the day,\\nWhile summer suns roll unperceived away!\\nHow oft our slowly-growing works impart,\\nWhile images reflect from art to art!\\nHow oft review; each finding, like a friend,\\nSomething to blame, and something to commend!\\nWhat flattering scenes our wandering fancy wrought,\\nRome's pompous glories rising to our thought!\\nTogether o'er the Alps methinks we fly,\\nFired with ideas of fair Italy.\\nWith thee on Raphael's monument I mourn.\\nOr wait inspiring dreams at Maro's urn:\\nWith thee repose where Tully once was laid,\\nOr seek some ruin's formidable shade:\\nWhile fancy brings the vanish'd piles to view.\\nAnd builds imaginary Rome anew.\\nHere thy well-studied marbles fix our eye;\\nA fading fresco here demands a sigh:\\nEach heavenly piece unwearied we compare,\\nMatch Raphael's grace with thy loved Guide's air,\\nCarracci's strength, Correggio's softer line,\\nPaulo's free stroke, and Titian's warmth divine.\\nHow finish'd with illustrious toil appears\\nThis small, well-polish'd gem, the work of years!\\nYet still how faint by precept is express'd\\nThe living image in the painter's breast!\\nThence endless streams of fair ideas flow,\\nStrike in the sketch, or in the picture glow;\\nThence Beauty, waking all her forms, supplies\\nAn angel's sweetness, or Bridgewater's eyes.\\nMuse! at that name thy sacred sorrows shed,\\nThose tears eternal, that embalm the dead;\\nCall round her tomb each object of desire,\\nEach purer frame inform'd with purer fire:\\nBid her be all that cheers or softens life,\\nThe tender sister, daughter, friend, and wife:\\nBid her be all that makes mankind adore;\\nThen view this marble, and be vain no more!\\nYet still her charms in breathing paint engage;\\nHer modest cheek shall warm a future age.\\nBeauty, frail flower that every season fears,\\nBlooms in thy colours for a thousand years.\\nThus Churchill's race shall other hearts surprise,\\nAnd other beauties envy Worsley's eyes;\\nEach pleasing Blount shall endless smiles bestow,\\nAnd soft Belinda's blush for ever glow.\\nOh, lasting as those colours may they shine,\\nFree as thy stroke, yet faultless as thy line;\\nNew graces yearly like thy works display,\\nSoft without weakness, without glaring gay;\\nLed by some rule, that guides, but not constrains;\\nAnd finish'd more through happiness than pains.\\nThe kindred arts shall in their praise conspire,\\nOne dip the pencil, and one string the lyre.\\nYet should the Graces all thy figures place,\\nAnd breathe an air divine on every face;\\nYet should the Muses bid my numbers roll\\nStrong as their charms, and gentle as their soul;\\nWith Zeuxis' Helen thy Bridgewater vie,\\nAnd these be sung till Granville's Myra die:\\nAlas! how little from the grave we claim!\\nThou but preserv'st a face, and I a name.\\n\\nIn these gay thoughts the Loves and Graces shine,\\nAnd all the writer lives in every line;\\nHis easy art may happy nature seem,\\nTrifles themselves are elegant in him.\\nSure, to charm all was his peculiar fate,\\nWho without flattery pleased the fair and great;\\nStill with esteem no less conversed than read;\\nWith wit well-natured, and with books well-bred:\\nHis heart, his mistress, and his friend did share,\\nHis time, the Muse, the witty, and the fair.\\nThus wisely careless, innocently gay,\\nCheerful he play'd the trifle, Life, away;\\nTill Fate scarce felt his gentle breath suppress'd,\\nAs smiling infants sport themselves to rest.\\nEven rival wits did Voiture's death deplore,\\nAnd the gay mourn'd who never mourn'd before;\\nThe truest hearts for Voiture heaved with sighs,\\nVoiture was wept by all the brightest eyes:\\nThe Smiles and Loves had died in Voiture's death,\\nBut that for ever in his lines they breathe.\\nLet the strict life of graver mortals be\\nA long, exact, and serious comedy;\\nIn every scene some moral let it teach,\\nAnd if it can, at once both please and preach.\\nLet mine an innocent gay farce appear,\\nAnd more diverting still than regular,\\nHave humour, wit, a native ease and grace,\\nThough not too strictly bound to time and place:\\nCritics in wit, or life, are hard to please,\\nFew write to those, and none can live to these.\\nToo much your sex is by their forms confined,\\nSevere to all, but most to womankind;\\nCustom, grown blind with age, must be your guide;\\nYour pleasure is a vice, but not your pride;\\nBy nature yielding, stubborn but for fame;\\nMade slaves by honour, and made fools by shame.\\nMarriage may all those petty tyrants chase,\\nBut sets up one, a greater, in their place;\\nWell might you wish for change, by those accursed,\\nBut the last tyrant ever proves the worst.\\nStill in constraint your suffering sex remains,\\nOr bound in formal, or in real chains:\\nWhole years neglected, for some months adored,\\nThe fawning servant turns a haughty lord.\\nAh, quit not the free innocence of life,\\nFor the dull glory of a virtuous wife;\\nNor let false shows, or empty titles please:\\nAim not at joy, but rest content with ease!\\nThe gods, to curse Pamela with her prayers,\\nGave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares,\\nThe shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state,\\nAnd, to complete her bliss, a fool for mate.\\nShe glares in balls, front boxes, and the Ring,\\nA vain, unquiet, glittering, wretched thing!\\nPride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part:\\nShe sighs, and is no duchess at her heart.\\nBut, madam, if the Fates withstand, and you\\nAre destined Hymen's willing victim too:\\nTrust not too much your now resistless charms,\\nThose, age or sickness, soon or late, disarms:\\nGood-humour only teaches charms to last,\\nStill makes new conquests, and maintains the past;\\nLove, raised on beauty, will like that decay,\\nOur hearts may bear its slender chain a day;\\nAs flowery bands in wantonness are worn,\\nA morning's pleasure, and at evening torn;\\nThis binds in ties more easy, yet more strong,\\nThe willing heart, and only holds it long.\\nThus Voiture's early care still shone the same,\\nAnd Monthansier was only changed in name:\\nBy this, even now they live, even now they charm,\\nTheir wit still sparkling, and their flames still warm.\\nNow crown'd with myrtle, on the Elysian coast,\\nAmid those lovers, joys his gentle ghost:\\nPleased, while with smiles his happy lines you view,\\nAnd finds a fairer Rambouillet in you.\\nThe brightest eyes of France inspired his Muse;\\nThe brightest eyes of Britain now peruse;\\nAnd dead, as living, 'tis our author's pride\\nStill to charm those who charm the world beside.\\n\\nAs some fond virgin, whom her mother's care\\nDrags from the town to wholesome country air,\\nJust when she learns to roll a melting eye,\\nAnd hear a spark, yet think no danger nigh;\\nFrom the dear man unwilling she must sever,\\nYet takes one kiss before she parts for ever:\\nThus from the world fair Zephalinda flew,\\nSaw others happy, and with sighs withdrew;\\nNot that their pleasures caused her discontent,\\nShe sigh'd not that they staid, but that she went.\\nShe went to plain-work, and to purling brooks,\\nOld-fashion'd halls, dull aunts, and croaking rooks:\\nShe went from opera, park, assembly, play,\\nTo morning-walks, and prayers three hours a-day:\\nTo part her time 'twixt reading and bohea,\\nTo muse, and spill her solitary tea;\\nOr o'er cold coffee trifle with the spoon,\\nCount the slow clock, and dine exact at noon;\\nDivert her eyes with pictures in the fire,\\nHum half a tune, tell stories to the 'squire;\\nUp to her godly garret after seven,\\nThere starve and pray, for that's the way to heaven.\\nSome 'squire, perhaps, you take delight to rack;\\nWhose game is whist, whose treat, a toast in sack;\\nWho visits with a gun, presents you birds,\\nThen gives a smacking buss, and cries--No words!\\nOr with his hound comes hallooing from the stable,\\nMakes love with nods, and knees beneath a table;\\nWhose laughs are hearty, though his jests are coarse,\\nAnd loves you best of all things--but his horse.\\nIn some fair evening, on your elbow laid,\\nYou dream of triumphs in the rural shade;\\nIn pensive thought recall the fancied scene,\\nSee coronations rise on every green;\\nBefore you pass the imaginary sights\\nOf lords, and earls, and dukes, and garter'd knights,\\nWhile the spread fan o'ershades your closing eyes;\\nThen give one flirt, and all the vision flies.\\nThus vanish sceptres, coronets, and balls,\\nAnd leave you in lone woods, or empty walls!\\nSo when your slave, at some dear idle time,\\n(Not plagued with headaches, or the want of rhyme)\\nStands in the streets, abstracted from the crew,\\nAnd while he seems to study, thinks of you;\\nJust when his fancy paints your sprightly eyes,\\nOr sees the blush of soft Parthenia rise,\\nGay pats my shoulder, and you vanish quite,\\nStreets, chairs, and coxcombs rush upon my sight;\\nVex'd to be still in town, I knit my brow,\\nLook sour, and hum a tune, as you do now.\\n\\nOh, be thou blest with all that Heaven can

night comes on, we eager to pursue\\nThe combat still, and they ashamed to leave:\\nTill the last streaks of dying day withdrew,\\nAnd doubtful moonlight did our rage deceive.\\nIn the English fleet each ship resounds with joy,\\nAnd loud applause of their great leader's fame:\\nIn fiery dreams the Dutch they still destroy,\\nAnd, slumbering, smile at the imagined flame.\\nNot so the Holland fleet, who, tired and done,\\nStretch'd on their decks like weary oxen lie;\\nFaint sweats all down their mighty members run;\\nVast bulks which little souls but ill supply.\\nIn dreams they fearful precipices tread:\\nOr, shipwreck'd, labour to some distant shore:\\nOr in dark churches walk among the dead;\\nThey wake with horror, and dare sleep no more.\\nThe morn they look on with unwilling eyes,\\nTill from their main-top joyful news they hear\\nOf ships, which by their mould bring new supplies,\\nAnd in their colours Belgian lions bear.\\nOur watchful general had discern'd from far\\nThis mighty succour, which made glad the foe:\\nHe sigh'd, but, like a father of the war,\\nHis face spake hope, while deep his sorrows flow.\\nHis wounded men he first sends off to shore,\\nNever till now unwilling to obey:\\nThey, not their wounds, but want of strength deplore,\\nAnd think them happy who with him can stay.\\nThen to the rest, Rejoice, said he, to-day;\\nIn you the fortune of Great Britain lies:\\nAmong so brave a people, you are they\\nWhom Heaven has chose to fight for such a prize.\\nIf number English courages could quell,\\nWe should at first have shunn'd, not met, our foes,\\nWhose numerous sails the fearful only tell:\\nCourage from hearts and not from numbers grows.\\nHe said, nor needed more to say: with haste\\nTo their known stations cheerfully they go;\\nAnd all at once, disdaining to be last,\\nSolicit every gale to meet the foe.\\nNor did the encouraged Belgians long delay,\\nBut bold in others, not themselves, they stood:\\nSo thick, our navy scarce could steer their way,\\nBut seem'd to wander in a moving wood.\\nOur little fleet was now engaged so far,\\nThat, like the sword-fish in the whale, they fought:\\nThe combat only seem'd a civil war,\\nTill through their bowels we our passage wrought.\\nNever had valour, no not ours, before\\nDone aught like this upon the land or main,\\nWhere not to be o'ercome was to do more\\nThan all the conquests former kings did gain.\\nThe mighty ghosts of our great Harries rose,\\nAnd armed Edwards look'd with anxious eyes,\\nTo see this fleet among unequal foes,\\nBy which fate promised them their Charles should rise.\\nMeantime the Belgians tack upon our rear,\\nAnd raking chase-guns through our sterns they send:\\nClose by their fire ships, like jackals appear\\nWho on their lions for the prey attend.\\nSilent in smoke of cannon they come on:\\nSuch vapours once did fiery Cacus hide:\\nIn these the height of pleased revenge is shown,\\nWho burn contented by another's side.\\nSometimes from fighting squadrons of each fleet,\\nDeceived themselves, or to preserve some friend,\\nTwo grappling Ã†tnas on the ocean meet,\\nAnd English fires with Belgian flames contend.\\nNow at each tack our little fleet grows less;\\nAnd like maim'd fowl, swim lagging on the main:\\nTheir greater loss their numbers scarce confess,\\nWhile they lose cheaper than the English gain.\\nHave you not seen, when, whistled from the fist,\\nSome falcon stoops at what her eye design'd,\\nAnd, with her eagerness the quarry miss'd,\\nStraight flies at check, and clips it down the wind.\\nThe dastard crow that to the wood made wing,\\nAnd sees the groves no shelter can afford,\\nWith her loud caws her craven kind does bring,\\nWho, safe in numbers, cuff the noble bird.\\nAmong the Dutch thus Albemarle did fare:\\nHe could not conquer, and disdain'd to fly;\\nPast hope of safety, 'twas his latest care,\\nLike falling CÃ¦sar, decently to die.\\nYet pity did his manly spirit move,\\nTo see those perish who so well had fought;\\nAnd generously with his despair he strove,\\nResolved to live till he their safety wrought.\\nLet other muses write his prosperous fate,\\nOf conquer'd nations tell, and kings restored;\\nBut mine shall sing of his eclipsed estate,\\nWhich, like the sun's, more wonders does afford.\\nHe drew his mighty frigates all before,\\nOn which the foe his fruitless force employs:\\nHis weak ones deep into his rear he bore\\nRemote from guns, as sick men from the noise.\\nHis fiery cannon did their passage guide,\\nAnd following smoke obscured them from the foe:\\nThus Israel safe from the Egyptian's pride,\\nBy flaming pillars, and by clouds did go.\\nElsewhere the Belgian force we did defeat,\\nBut here our courages did theirs subdue:\\nSo Xenophon once led that famed retreat,\\nWhich first the Asian empire overthrew.\\nThe foe approach'd; and one for his bold sin\\nWas sunk; as he that touch'd the ark was slain:\\nThe wild waves master'd him and suck'd him in,\\nAnd smiling eddies dimpled on the main.\\nThis seen, the rest at awful distance stood:\\nAs if they had been there as servants set\\nTo stay, or to go on, as he thought good,\\nAnd not pursue, but wait on his retreat.\\nSo Lybian huntsmen, on some sandy plain,\\nFrom shady coverts roused, the lion chase:\\nThe kingly beast roars out with loud disdain,\\nAnd slowly moves, unknowing to give place.\\nBut if some one approach to dare his force,\\nHe swings his tail, and swiftly turns him round;\\nWith one paw seizes on his trembling horse,\\nAnd with the other tears him to the ground.\\nAmidst these toils succeeds the balmy night;\\nNow hissing waters the quench'd guns restore;\\nAnd weary waves, withdrawing from the fight,\\nLie lull'd and panting on the silent shore:\\nThe moon shone clear on the becalmed flood,\\nWhere, while her beams like glittering silver play,\\nUpon the deck our careful general stood,\\nAnd deeply mused on the succeeding day.\\nThat happy sun, said he, will rise again,\\nWho twice victorious did our navy see:\\nAnd I alone must view him rise in vain,\\nWithout one ray of all his star for me.\\nYet like an English general will I die,\\nAnd all the ocean make my spacious grave:\\nWomen and cowards on the land may lie;\\nThe sea's a tomb that's proper for the brave.\\nRestless he pass'd the remnant of the night,\\nTill the fresh air proclaimed the morning nigh:\\nAnd burning ships, the martyrs of the fight,\\nWith paler fires beheld the eastern sky.\\nBut now, his stores of ammunition spent,\\nHis naked valour is his only guard;\\nRare thunders are from his dumb cannon sent,\\nAnd solitary guns are scarcely heard.\\nThus far had fortune power, here forced to stay,\\nNor longer durst with virtue be at strife:\\nThis as a ransom Albemarle did pay,\\nFor all the glories of so great a life.\\nFor now brave Rupert from afar appears,\\nWhose waving streamers the glad general knows:\\nWith full spread sails his eager navy steers,\\nAnd every ship in swift proportion grows.\\nThe anxious prince had heard the cannon long,\\nAnd from that length of time dire omens drew\\nOf English overmatch'd, and Dutch too strong,\\nWho never fought three days, but to pursue.\\nThen, as an eagle, who, with pious care\\nWas beating widely on the wing for prey,\\nTo her now silent eyrie does repair,\\nAnd finds her callow infants forced away:\\nStung with her love, she stoops upon the plain,\\nThe broken air loud whistling as she flies:\\nShe stops and listens, and shoots forth again,\\nAnd guides her pinions by her young ones' cries.\\nWith such kind passion hastes the prince to fight,\\nAnd spreads his flying canvas to the sound;\\nHim, whom no danger, were he there, could fright,\\nNow absent every little noise can wound.\\nAs in a drought the thirsty creatures cry,\\nAnd gape upon the gather'd clouds for rain,\\nAnd first the martlet meets it in the sky,\\nAnd with wet wings joys all the feather'd train.\\nWith such glad hearts did our despairing men\\nSalute the appearance of the prince's fleet;\\nAnd each ambitiously would claim the ken,\\nThat with first eyes did distant safety meet.\\nThe Dutch, who came like greedy hinds before,\\nTo reap the harvest their ripe ears did yield,\\nNow look like those, when rolling thunders roar,\\nAnd sheets of lightning blast the standing field.\\nFull in the prince's passage, hills of sand,\\nAnd dangerous flats in secret ambush lay;\\nWhere the false tides skim o'er the cover'd land,\\nAnd seamen with dissembled depths betray.\\nThe wily Dutch, who, like fallen angels, fear'd\\nThis new Messiah's coming, there did wait,\\nAnd round the verge their braving vessels steer'd,\\nTo tempt his courage with so fair a bait.\\nBut he, unmoved, contemns their idle threat,\\nSecure of fame whene'er he please to fight:\\nHis cold experience tempers all his heat,\\nAnd inbred worth doth boasting valour slight.\\nHeroic virtue did his actions guide,\\nAnd he the substance, not the appearance chose\\nTo rescue one such friend he took more pride,\\nThan to destroy whole thousands of such foes.\\nBut when approach'd, in strict embraces bound,\\nRupert and Albemarle together grow;\\nHe joys to have his friend in safety found,\\nWhich he to none but to that friend would owe.\\nThe cheerful soldiers, with new stores supplied,\\nNow long to execute their spleenful will;\\nAnd, in revenge for those three days they tried,\\nWish one, like Joshua's, when the sun stood still.\\nThus reinforced, against the adverse fleet,\\nStill doubling ours, brave Rupert leads the way:\\nWith the first blushes of the morn they meet,\\nAnd bring night back upon the new-born day.\\nHis presence soon blows up the kindling fight,\\nAnd his loud guns speak thick like angry men:\\nIt seem'd as slaughter had been breathed all night,\\nAnd Death new pointed his dull dart again.\\nThe Dutch too well his mighty conduct knew,\\nAnd matchless courage since the former fight;\\nWhose navy like a stiff-stretch'd cord did show,\\nTill he bore in and bent them into flight.\\nThe wind he shares, while half their fleet offends\\nHis open side, and high above him shows:\\nUpon the rest at pleasure he descends,\\nAnd doubly harm'd he double harms bestows.\\nBehind the general mends his weary pace,\\nAnd sullenly to his revenge he sails:\\nSo glides some trodden serpent on the grass,\\nAnd long behind his wounded volume trails.\\nThe increasing sound is borne to either shore,\\nAnd for their stakes the throwing nations fear:\\nTheir passions double with the cannons' roar,\\nAnd with warm wishes each man combats there.\\nPlied thick and close as when the fight begun,\\nTheir huge unwieldy navy wastes away;\\nSo sicken waning moons too near the sun,\\nAnd blunt their crescents on the edge of day.\\nAnd now reduced on equal terms to fight,\\nTheir ships like wasted patrimonies show;\\nWhere the thin scattering trees admit the light,\\nAnd shun each other's shadows as they grow.\\nThe warlike prince had sever'd from the rest\\nTwo giant ships, the pride of all the main;\\nWhich with his one so vigorously he prest,\\nAnd flew so home they could not rise again.\\nAlready batter'd, by his lee they lay,\\nIn rain upon the passing winds they call:\\nThe passing winds through their torn canvas play,\\nAnd flagging sails on heartless sailors fall.\\nTheir open'd sides receive a gloomy light,\\nDreadful as day let into shades below:\\nWithout, grim Death rides barefaced in their sight,\\nAnd urges entering billows as they flow.\\nWhen one dire shot, the last they could supply,\\nClose by the board the prince's mainmast bore:\\nAll three now helpless by each other lie,\\nAnd this offends not, and those fear no more.\\nSo have I seen some fearful hare maintain\\nA course, till tired before the dog she lay:\\nWho, stretch'd behind her, pants upon the plain,\\nPast power to kill, as she to get away.\\nWith his loll'd tongue he faintly licks his prey;\\nHis warm breath blows her flix up as she lies;\\nShe trembling creeps upon the ground away,\\nAnd looks back to him with beseeching eyes.\\nThe prince unjustly does his stars accuse,\\nWhich hinder'd him to push his fortune on;\\nFor what they to his courage did refuse,\\nBy mortal valour never must be done.\\nThis lucky hour the wise Batavian takes,\\nAnd warns his tatter'd fleet to follow home;\\nProud to have so got off with equal stakes,\\nWhere 'twas a triumph not to be o'ercome.\\nThe general's force, as kept alive by fight,\\nNow not opposed, no longer can pursue:\\nLasting till heaven had done his courage right;\\nWhen he had conquer'd he his weakness knew.\\nHe casts a frown on the departing foe,\\nAnd sighs to see him quit the watery field:\\nHis stern fix'd eyes no satisfaction show,\\nFor all the glories which the fight did yield.\\nThough, as when fiends did miracles avow,\\nHe stands confess'd e'en by the boastful Dutch:\\nHe only does his conquest disavow,\\nAnd thinks too little what they found too much.\\nReturn'd, he with the fleet resolved to stay;\\nNo tender thoughts of home his heart divide;\\nDomestic joys and cares he puts away;\\nFor realms are households which the great must guide.\\nAs those who unripe veins in mines explore,\\nOn the rich bed again the warm turf lay,\\nTill time digests the yet imperfect ore,\\nAnd know it will be gold another day:\\nSo looks our monarch on this early fight,\\nTh' essay and rudiments of great success;\\nWhich all-maturing time must bring to light,\\nWhile he, like Heaven, does each day's labour bless.\\nHeaven ended not the first or second day,\\nYet each was perfect to the work design'd;\\nGod and king's work, when they their work survey,\\nA passive aptness in all subjects find.\\nIn burden'd vessels first, with speedy care,\\nHis plenteous stores do seasoned timber send;\\nThither the brawny carpenters repair,\\nAnd as the surgeons of maim'd ships attend.\\nWith cord and canvas from rich Hamburgh sent,\\nHis navy's molted wings he imps once more:\\nTall Norway fir, their masts in battle spent,\\nAnd English oak, sprung leaks and planks restore.\\nAll hands employ'd, the royal work grows warm:\\nLike labouring bees on a long summer's day,\\nSome sound the trumpet for the rest to swarm.\\nAnd some on bells of tasted lilies play.\\nWith gluey wax some new foundations lay\\nOf virgin-combs, which from the roof are hung:\\nSome arm'd, within doors upon duty stay,\\nOr tend the sick, or educate the young.\\nSo here some pick out bullets from the sides,\\nSome drive old oakum through each seam and rift:\\nTheir left hand does the calking-iron guide,\\nThe rattling mallet with the right they lift.\\nWith boiling pitch another near at hand,\\nFrom friendly Sweden brought, the seams instops:\\nWhich well paid o'er, the salt sea waves withstand,\\nAnd shakes them from the rising beak in drops.\\nSome the gall'd ropes with dauby marline bind,\\nOr sear-cloth masts with strong tarpaulin coats:\\nTo try new shrouds one mounts into the wind,\\nAnd one below their ease or stiffness notes.\\nOur careful monarch stands in person by,\\nHis new-cast cannons' firmness to explore:\\nThe strength of big-corn'd powder loves to try,\\nAnd ball and cartridge sorts for every bore.\\nEach day brings fresh supplies of arms and men,\\nAnd ships which all last winter were abroad;\\nAnd such as fitted since the fight had been,\\nOr, new from stocks, were fallen into the road.\\nThe goodly London in her gallant trim\\n(The Phoenix daughter of the vanish'd old).\\nLike a rich bride does to the ocean swim,\\nAnd on her shadow rides in floating gold.\\nHer flag aloft spread ruffling to the wind,\\nAnd sanguine streamers seem the flood to fire;\\nThe weaver, charm'd with what his loom design'd,\\nGoes on to sea, and knows not to retire.\\nWith roomy decks, her guns of mighty strength,\\nWhose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves;\\nDeep in her draught, and warlike in her length,\\nShe seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves.\\nThis martial present, piously design'd,\\nThe loyal city give their best-loved King:\\nAnd with a bounty ample as the wind,\\nBuilt, fitted, and maintain'd, to aid him bring.\\nBy viewing Nature, Nature's handmaid, Art,\\nMakes mighty things from small beginnings grow:\\nThus fishes first to shipping did impart,\\nTheir tail the rudder, and their head the prow.\\nSome log perhaps upon the waters swam,\\nAn useless drift, which, rudely cut within,\\nAnd, hollow'd, first a floating trough became,\\nAnd cross some rivulet passage did begin.\\nIn shipping such as this, the Irish kern,\\nAnd untaught Indian, on the stream did glide:\\nEre sharp-keel'd boats to stem the flood did learn,\\nOr fin-like oars did spread from either side.\\nAdd but a sail, and Saturn so appear'd,\\nWhen from lost empire he to exile went,\\nAnd with the golden age to Tiber steer'd,\\nWhere coin and commerce first he did invent.\\nRude as their ships was navigation then;\\nNo useful compass or meridian known;\\nCoasting, they kept the land within their ken,\\nAnd knew no North but when the Pole-star shone.\\nOf all who since have used the open sea,\\nThan the bold English none more fame have won:\\nBeyond the year, and out of heaven's high way,\\nThey make discoveries where they see no sun.\\nBut what so long in vain, and yet unknown,\\nBy poor mankind's benighted wit is sought,\\nShall in this age to Britain first be shown,\\nAnd hence be to admiring nations taught.\\nThe ebbs of tides and their mysterious flow,\\nWe, as art's elements, shall understand,\\nAnd as by line upon the ocean go,\\nWhose paths shall be familiar as the land.\\nInstructed ships shall sail to quick commerce,\\nBy which remotest regions are allied;\\nWhich makes one city of the universe,\\nWhere some may gain, and all may be supplied.\\nThen we upon our globe's last verge shall go,\\nAnd view the ocean leaning on the sky:\\nFrom thence our rolling neighbours we shall know,\\nAnd on the lunar world securely pry.\\nThis I foretell from your auspicious care,\\nWho great in search of God and nature grow;\\nWho best your wise Creator's praise declare,\\nSince best to praise his works is best to know.\\nO truly royal! who behold the law\\nAnd rule of beings in your Maker's mind:\\nAnd thence, like limbecks, rich ideas draw,\\nTo fit the levell'd use of human-kind.\\nBut first the toils of war we must endure,\\nAnd from the injurious Dutch redeem the seas.\\nWar makes the valiant of his right secure,\\nAnd gives up fraud to be chastised with ease.\\nAlready were the Belgians on our coast,\\nWhose fleet more mighty every day became\\nBy late success, which they did falsely boast,\\nAnd now by first appearing seem'd to claim.\\nDesigning, subtle, diligent, and close,\\nThey knew to manage war with wise delay:\\nYet all those arts their vanity did cross,\\nAnd by their pride their prudence did betray.\\nNor stay'd the English long; but, well supplied,\\nAppear as numerous as the insulting foe:\\nThe combat now by courage must be tried,\\nAnd the success the braver nation show.\\nThere was the Plymouth squadron now come in,\\nWhich in the Straits last winter was abroad;\\nWhich twice on Biscay's working bay had been,\\nAnd on the midland sea the French had awed.\\nOld expert Allen, loyal all along,\\nFamed for his action on the Smyrna fleet:\\nAnd Holmes, whose name shall live in epic song,\\nWhile music numbers, or while verse has feet.\\nHolmes, the Achates of the general's fight;\\nWho first bewitch'd our eyes with Guinea gold;\\nAs once old Cato in the Roman sight\\nThe tempting fruits of Afric did unfold.\\nWith him went Spragge, as bountiful as brave,\\nWhom his high courage to command had brought:\\nHarman, who did the twice-fired Harry save,\\nAnd in his burning ship undaunted fought.\\nYoung Hollis, on a Muse by Mars begot,\\nBorn, CÃ¦sar-like, to write and act great deeds:\\nImpatient to revenge his fatal shot,\\nHis right hand doubly to his left succeeds.\\nThousands were there in darker fame that dwell,\\nWhose deeds some nobler poem shall adorn:\\nAnd, though to me unknown, they sure fought well\\nWhom Rupert led, and who were British born.\\nOf every size an hundred fighting sail:\\nSo vast the navy now at anchor rides,\\nThat underneath it the press'd waters fail,\\nAnd with its weight it shoulders off the tides.\\nNow anchors weigh'd, the seamen shout so shrill,\\nThat heaven and earth and the wide ocean rings:\\nA breeze from westward waits their sails to fill,\\nAnd rests in those high beds his downy wings.\\nThe wary Dutch this gathering storm foresaw,\\nAnd durst not bide it on the English coast:\\nBehind their treacherous shallows they withdraw,\\nAnd there lay snares to catch the British host.\\nSo the false spider, when her nets are spread,\\nDeep ambush'd in her silent den does lie:\\nAnd feels far off the trembling of her thread,\\nWhose filmy cord should bind the struggling fly.\\nThen if at last she find him fast beset,\\nShe issues forth and runs along her loom:\\nShe joys to touch the captive in her net,\\nAnd drags the little wretch in triumph home.\\nThe Belgians hoped, that, with disorder'd haste,\\nOur deep-cut keels upon the sands might run:\\nOr, if with caution leisurely were past,\\nTheir numerous gross might charge us one by one.\\nBut with a fore-wind pushing them above,\\nAnd swelling tide that heaved them from below,\\nO'er the blind flats our warlike squadrons move,\\nAnd with spread sails to welcome battle go.\\nIt seem'd as there the British Neptune stood,\\nWith all his hosts of waters at command.\\nBeneath them to submit the officious flood;\\nAnd with his trident shoved them off the sand.\\nTo the pale foes they suddenly draw near,\\nAnd summon them to unexpected fight:\\nThey start like murderers when ghosts appear,\\nAnd draw their curtains in the dead of night.\\nNow van to van the foremost squadrons meet,\\nThe midmost battles hastening up behind,\\nWho view far off the storm of falling sleet,\\nAnd hear their thunder rattling in the wind.\\nAt length the adverse admirals appear;\\nThe two bold champions of each country's right:\\nTheir eyes describe the lists as they come near,\\nAnd draw the lines of death before they fight.\\nThe distance judged for shot of every size,\\nThe linstocks touch, the ponderous ball expires:\\nThe vigorous seaman every port-hole plies,\\nAnd adds his heart to every gun he fires!\\nFierce was the fight on the proud Belgians' side,\\nFor honour, which they seldom sought before!\\nBut now they by their own vain boasts were tied,\\nAnd forced at least in show to prize it more.\\nBut sharp remembrance on the English part,\\nAnd shame of being match'd by such a foe,\\nRouse conscious virtue up in every heart,\\nAnd seeming to be stronger makes them so.\\nNor long the Belgians could that fleet sustain,\\nWhich did two generals' fates, and CÃ¦sar's bear:\\nEach several ship a victory did gain,\\nAs Rupert or as Albemarle were there.\\nTheir batter'd admiral too soon withdrew,\\nUnthank'd by ours for his unfinish'd fight;\\nBut he the minds of his Dutch masters knew,\\nWho call'd that Providence which we call'd flight.\\nNever did men more joyfully obey,\\nOr sooner understood the sign to fly:\\nWith such alacrity they bore away,\\nAs if to praise them all the States stood by.\\nO famous leader of the Belgian fleet,\\nThy monument inscribed such praise shall wear,\\nAs Varro, timely flying, once did meet,\\nBecause he did not of his Rome despair.\\nBehold that navy, which a while before,\\nProvoked the tardy English close to fight,\\nNow draw their beaten vessels close to shore,\\nAs larks lie, dared, to shun the hobby's flight.\\nWhoe'er would English monuments survey,\\nIn other records may our courage know:\\nBut let them hide the story of this day,\\nWhose fame was blemish'd by too base a foe.\\nOr if too busily they will inquire\\nInto a victory which we disdain;\\nThen let them know the Belgians did retire\\nBefore the patron saint of injured Spain.\\nRepenting England this revengeful day\\nTo Philip's manes did an offering bring:\\nEngland, which first by leading them astray,\\nHatch'd up rebellion to destroy her King.\\nOur fathers bent their baneful industry,\\nTo check a, monarchy that slowly grew;\\nBut did not France or Holland's fate foresee,\\nWhose rising power to swift dominion flew.\\nIn fortune's empire blindly thus we go,\\nAnd wander after pathless destiny;\\nWhose dark resorts since prudence cannot know,\\nIn vain it would provide for what shall be.\\nBut whate'er English to the bless'd shall go,\\nAnd the fourth Harry or first Orange meet;\\nFind him disowning of a Bourbon foe,\\nAnd him detesting a Batavian fleet.\\nNow on their coasts our conquering navy rides,\\nWaylays their merchants, and their land besets:\\nEach day new wealth without their care provides;\\nThey lie asleep with prizes in their nets.\\nSo, close behind some promontory lie\\nThe huge leviathans to attend their prey;\\nAnd give no chase, but swallow in the fry,\\nWhich through their gaping jaws mistake the way.\\nNor was this all: in ports and roads remote,\\nDestructive fires among whole fleets we send:\\nTriumphant flames upon the water float,\\nAnd out-bound ships at home their voyage end.\\nThose various squadrons variously design'd,\\nEach vessel freighted with a several load,\\nEach squadron waiting for a several wind,\\nAll find but one, to burn them in the road.\\nSome bound for Guinea, golden sand to find,\\nBore all the gauds the simple natives wear;\\nSome for the pride of Turkish courts design'd,\\nFor folded turbans finest Holland bear.\\nSome English wool, vex'd in a Belgian loom,\\nAnd into cloth of spungy softness made,\\nDid into France, or colder Denmark, doom,\\nTo ruin with worse ware our staple trade.\\nOur greedy seamen rummage every hold,\\nSmile on the booty of each wealthier chest;\\nAnd, as the priests who with their gods make bold,\\nTake what they like, and sacrifice the rest.\\nBut ah! how insincere are all our joys!\\nWhich, sent from heaven, like lightning make no stay;\\nTheir palling taste the journey's length destroys,\\nOr grief, sent post, o'ertakes them on the way.\\nSwell'd with our late successes on the foe,\\nWhich France and Holland wanted power to cross,\\nWe urge an unseen fate to lay us low,\\nAnd feed their envious eyes with English loss.\\nEach element His dread command obeys,\\nWho makes or ruins with a smile or frown;\\nWho, as by one he did our nation raise,\\nSo now he with another pulls us down.\\nYet London, empress of the northern clime,\\nBy an high fate thou greatly didst expire;\\nGreat as the world's, which, at the death of time\\nMust fall, and rise a nobler frame by fire!\\nAs when some dire usurper Heaven provides,\\nTo scourge his country with a lawless sway;\\nHis birth perhaps some petty village hides,\\nAnd sets his cradle out of fortune's way.\\nTill fully ripe his swelling fate breaks out,\", \"And hurries him to mighty mischiefs on:\\nHis prince, surprised at first, no ill could doubt,\\nAnd wants the power to meet it when 'tis known.\\nSuch was the rise of this prodigious fire,\\nWhich, in mean buildings first obscurely bred,\\nFrom thence did soon to open streets aspire,\\nAnd straight to palaces and temples spread.\\nThe diligence of trades and noiseful gain,\\nAnd luxury more late, asleep were laid:\\nAll was the night's; and in her silent reign\\nNo sound the rest of nature did invade.\\nIn this deep quiet, from what source unknown,\\nThose seeds of fire their fatal birth disclose;\\nAnd first few scattering sparks about were blown,\\nBig with the flames that to our ruin rose.\\nThen in some close-pent room it crept along,\\nAnd, smouldering as it went, in silence fed;\\nTill the infant monster, with devouring strong,\\nWalk'd boldly upright with exalted head.\\nNow like some rich or mighty murderer,\\nToo great for prison, which he breaks with gold;\\nWho fresher for new mischiefs does appear,\\nAnd dares the world to tax him with the old:\\nSo 'scapes the insulting fire his narrow jail,\\nAnd makes small outlets into open air:\\nThere the fierce winds his tender force assail,\\nAnd beat him downward to his first repair.\\nThe winds, like crafty courtesans, withheld\\nHis flames from burning, but to blow them more:\\nAnd every fresh attempt he is repell'd\\nWith faint denials weaker than before.\\nAnd now no longer letted of his prey,\\nHe leaps up at it with enraged desire:\\nO'erlooks the neighbours with a wide survey,\\nAnd nods at every house his threatening fire.\\nThe ghosts of traitors from the bridge descend,\\nWith bold fanatic spectres to rejoice:\\nAbout the fire into a dance they bend,\\nAnd sing their sabbath notes with feeble voice.\\nOur guardian angel saw them where they sate\\nAbove the palace of our slumbering king:\\nHe sigh'd, abandoning his charge to fate,\\nAnd, drooping, oft look'd back upon the wing.\\nAt length the crackling noise and dreadful blaze\\nCall'd up some waking lover to the sight;\\nAnd long it was ere he the rest could raise,\\nWhose heavy eyelids yet were full of night.\\nThe next to danger, hot pursued by fate,\\nHalf-clothed, half-naked, hastily retire:\\nAnd frighted mothers strike their breasts too late,\\nFor helpless infants left amidst the fire.\\nTheir cries soon waken all the dwellers near;\\nNow murmuring noises rise in every street:\\nThe more remote run stumbling with their fear,\\nAnd in the dark men jostle as they meet.\\nSo weary bees in little cells repose;\\nBut if night-robbers lift the well-stored hive,\\nAn humming through their waxen city grows,\\nAnd out upon each other's wings they drive.\\nNow streets grow throng'd and busy as by day:\\nSome run for buckets to the hallow'd quire:\\nSome cut the pipes, and some the engines play;\\nAnd some more bold mount ladders to the fire.\\nIn vain: for from the east a Belgian wind\\nHis hostile breath through the dry rafters sent;\\nThe flames impell'd soon left their foes behind,\\nAnd forward with a wanton fury went.\\nA quay of fire ran all along the shore,\\nAnd lighten'd all the river with a blaze:\\nThe waken'd tides began again to roar,\\nAnd wondering fish in shining waters gaze.\\nOld father Thames raised up his reverend head,\\nBut fear'd the fate of Simois would return:\\nDeep in his ooze he sought his sedgy bed,\\nAnd shrunk his waters back into his urn.\\nThe fire, meantime, walks in a broader gross;\\nTo either hand his wings he opens wide:\\nHe wades the streets, and straight he reaches cross,\\nAnd plays his longing flames on the other side.\\nAt first they warm, then scorch, and then they take;\\nNow with long necks from side to side they feed:\\nAt length, grown strong, their mother-fire forsake,\\nAnd a new colony of flames succeed.\\nTo every nobler portion of the town\\nThe curling billows roll their restless tide:\\nIn parties now they straggle up and down,\\nAs armies, unopposed, for prey divide.\\nOne mighty squadron with a side-wind sped,\\nThrough narrow lanes his cumber'd fire does haste,\\nBy powerful charms of gold and silver led,\\nThe Lombard bankers and the 'Change to waste.\\nAnother backward to the Tower would go,\\nAnd slowly eats his way against the wind:\\nBut the main body of the marching foe\\nAgainst the imperial palace is design'd.\\nNow day appears, and with the day the King,\\nWhose early care had robb'd him of his rest:\\nFar off the cracks of falling houses ring,\\nAnd shrieks of subjects pierce his tender breast.\\nNear as he draws, thick harbingers of smoke\\nWith gloomy pillars cover all the place;\\nWhose little intervals of night are broke\\nBy sparks, that drive against his sacred face.\\nMore than his guards, his sorrows made him known,\\nAnd pious tears, which down his cheeks did shower;\\nThe wretched in his grief forgot their own;\\nSo much the pity of a king has power.\\nHe wept the flames of what he loved so well,\\nAnd what so well had merited his love:\\nFor never prince in grace did more excel,\\nOr royal city more in duty strove.\\nNor with an idle care did he behold:\\nSubjects may grieve, but monarchs must redress;\\nHe cheers the fearful, and commends the bold,\\nAnd makes despairers hope for good success.\\nHimself directs what first is to be done,\\nAnd orders all the succours which they bring,\\nThe helpful and the good about him run,\\nAnd form an army worthy such a king.\\nHe sees the dire contagion spread so fast,\\nThat, where it seizes, all relief is vain:\\nAnd therefore must unwillingly lay waste\\nThat country, which would else the foe maintain.\\nThe powder blows up all before the fire:\\nThe amazÃ¨d flames stand gather'd on a heap;\\nAnd from the precipice's brink retire,\\nAfraid to venture on so large a leap.\\nThus fighting fires a while themselves consume,\\nBut straight, like Turks forced on to win or die,\\nThey first lay tender bridges of their fume,\\nAnd o'er the breach in unctuous vapours fly.\\nPart stay for passage, till a gust of wind\\nShips o'er their forces in a shining sheet:\\nPart creeping under ground their journey blind,\\nAnd climbing from below their fellows meet.\\nThus to some desert plain, or old woodside,\\nDire night-hags come from far to dance their round;\\nAnd o'er broad rivers on their fiends they ride,\\nOr sweep in clouds above the blasted ground.\\nNo help avails: for hydra-like, the fire\\nLifts up his hundred heads to aim his way;\\nAnd scarce the wealthy can one half retire,\\nBefore he rushes in to share the prey.\\nThe rich grow suppliant, and the poor grow proud;\\nThose offer mighty gain, and these ask more:\\nSo void of pity is the ignoble crowd,\\nWhen others' ruin may increase their store.\\nAs those who live by shores with joy behold\\nSome wealthy vessel split or stranded nigh;\\nAnd from the rocks leap down for shipwreck'd gold,\\nAnd seek the tempests which the others fly:\\nSo these but wait the owners' last despair,\\nAnd what's permitted to the flames invade;\\nEven from their jaws they hungry morsels tear,\\nAnd on their backs the spoils of Vulcan lade.\\nThe days were all in this lost labour spent;\\nAnd when the weary king gave place to night,\\nHis beams he to his royal brother lent,\\nAnd so shone still in his reflective light.\\nNight came, but without darkness or repose,--\\nA dismal picture of the general doom,\\nWhere souls, distracted when the trumpet blows,\\nAnd half unready, with their bodies come.\\nThose who have homes, when home they do repair,\\nTo a last lodging call their wandering friends:\\nTheir short uneasy sleeps are broke with care,\\nTo look how near their own destruction tends.\\nThose who have none, sit round where once it was,\\nAnd with full eyes each wonted room require;\\nHaunting the yet warm ashes of the place,\\nAs murder'd men walk where they did expire.\\nSome stir up coals, and watch the vestal fire,\\nOthers in vain from sight of ruin run;\\nAnd, while through burning labyrinths they retire,\\nWith loathing eyes repeat what they would shun.\\nThe most in fields like herded beasts lie down,\\nTo dews obnoxious on the grassy floor;\\nAnd while their babes in sleep their sorrows drown,\\nSad parents watch the remnants of their store.\\nWhile by the motion of the flames they guess\\nWhat streets are burning now, and what are near;\\nAn infant waking to the paps would press,\\nAnd meets, instead of milk, a falling tear.\\nNo thought can ease them but their sovereign's care,\\nWhose praise the afflicted as their comfort sing:\\nEven those whom want might drive to just despair,\\nThink life a blessing under such a king.\\nMeantime he sadly suffers in their grief,\\nOut-weeps an hermit, and out-prays a saint:\\nAll the long night he studies their relief,\\nHow they may be supplied, and he may want.\\nO God, said he, thou patron of my days,\\nGuide of my youth in exile and distress!\\nWho me, unfriended, brought'st by wondrous ways,\\nThe kingdom of my fathers to possess:\\nBe thou my judge, with what unwearied care\\nI since have labour'd for my people's good;\\nTo bind the bruises of a civil war,\\nAnd stop the issues of their wasting blood.\\nThou who hast taught me to forgive the ill,\\nAnd recompense, as friends, the good misled;\\nIf mercy be a precept of thy will,\\nReturn that mercy on thy servant's head.\\nOr if my heedless youth has stepp'd astray,\\nToo soon forgetful of thy gracious hand;\\nOn me alone thy just displeasure lay,\\nBut take thy judgments from this mourning land.\\nWe all have sinn'd, and thou hast laid us low,\\nAs humble earth from whence at first we came:\\nLike flying shades before the clouds we show,\\nAnd shrink like parchment in consuming flame.\\nO let it be enough what thou hast done;\\nWhen spotted Deaths ran arm'd through every street,\\nWith poison'd darts which not the good could shun,\\nThe speedy could out-fly, or valiant meet.\\nThe living few, and frequent funerals then,\\nProclaim'd thy wrath on this forsaken place;\\nAnd now those few who are return'd again,\\nThy searching judgments to their dwellings trace.\\nO pass not, Lord, an absolute decree,\\nOr bind thy sentence unconditional!\\nBut in thy sentence our remorse foresee,\\nAnd in that foresight this thy doom recall.\\nThy threatenings, Lord, as thine thou mayst revoke:\\nBut if immutable and fix'd they stand,\\nContinue still thyself to give the stroke,\\nAnd let not foreign foes oppress thy land.\\nThe Eternal heard, and from the heavenly quire\\nChose out the cherub with the flaming sword;\\nAnd bade him swiftly drive the approaching fire\\nFrom where our naval magazines were stored.\\nThe blessed minister his wings display'd,\\nAnd like a shooting star he cleft the night:\\nHe charged the flames, and those that disobey'd\\nHe lash'd to duty with his sword of light.\\nThe fugitive flames chastised went forth to prey\\nOn pious structures, by our fathers rear'd;\\nBy which to heaven they did affect the way,\\nEre faith in churchmen without works was heard.\\nThe wanting orphans saw, with watery eyes,\\nTheir founder's charity in dust laid low;\\nAnd sent to God their ever-answered cries,\\nFor He protects the poor, who made them so.\\nNor could thy fabric, Paul's, defend thee long,\\nThough thou wert sacred to thy Maker's praise:\\nThough made immortal by a poet's song;\\nAnd poets' songs the Theban walls could raise.\\nThe daring flames peep'd in, and saw from far\\nThe awful beauties of the sacred quire:\\nBut since it was profaned by civil war,\\nHeaven thought it fit to have it purged by fire.\\nNow down the narrow streets it swiftly came,\\nAnd widely opening did on both sides prey:\\nThis benefit we sadly owe the flame,\\nIf only ruin must enlarge our way.\\nAnd now four days the sun had seen our woes:\\nFour nights the moon beheld the incessant fire:\\nIt seem'd as if the stars more sickly rose,\\nAnd farther from the feverish north retire.\\nIn th' empyrean heaven, the bless'd abode,\\nThe Thrones and the Dominions prostrate lie,\\nNot daring to behold their angry God;\\nAnd a hush'd silence damps the tuneful sky.\\nAt length the Almighty cast a pitying eye,\\nAnd mercy softly touch'd his melting breast:\\nHe saw the town's one half in rubbish lie,\\nAnd eager flames drive on to storm the rest.\\nAn hollow crystal pyramid he takes,\\nIn firmamental waters dipt above;\\nOf it a broad extinguisher he makes,\\nAnd hoods the flames that to their quarry drove.\\nThe vanquish'd fires withdraw from every place,\\nOr, full with feeding, sink into a sleep:\\nEach household genius shows again his face,\\nAnd from the hearths the little Lares creep.\\nOur King this more than natural change beholds;\\nWith sober joy his heart and eyes abound:\\nTo the All-good his lifted hands he folds,\\nAnd thanks him low on his redeemed ground.\\nAs when sharp frosts had long constrain'd the earth,\\nA kindly thaw unlocks it with mild rain;\\nAnd first the tender blade peeps up to birth,\\nAnd straight the green fields laugh with promised grain:\\nBy such degrees the spreading gladness grew\\nIn every heart which fear had froze before:\\nThe standing streets with so much joy they view,\\nThat with less grief the perish'd they deplore.\\nThe father of the people open'd wide\\nHis stores, and all the poor with plenty fed:\\nThus God's anointed God's own place supplied,\\nAnd fill'd the empty with his daily bread.\\nThis royal bounty brought its own reward,\\nAnd in their minds so deep did print the sense,\\nThat if their ruins sadly they regard,\\n'Tis but with fear the sight might drive him thence.\\nBut so may he live long, that town to sway,\\nWhich by his auspice they will nobler make,\\nAs he will hatch their ashes by his stay,\\nAnd not their humble ruins now forsake.\\nThey have not lost their loyalty by fire;\\nNor is their courage or their wealth so low,\\nThat from his wars they poorly would retire,\\nOr beg the pity of a vanquish'd foe.\\nNot with more constancy the Jews of old,\\nBy Cyrus from rewarded exile sent,\\nTheir royal city did in dust behold,\\nOr with more vigour to rebuild it went.\\nThe utmost malice of their stars is past,\\nAnd two dire comets, which have scourged the town,\\nIn their own plague and fire have breathed the last,\\nOr dimly in their sinking sockets frown.\\nNow frequent trines the happier lights among,\\nAnd high-raised Jove, from his dark prison freed,\\nThose weights took off that on his planet hung,\\nWill gloriously the new-laid work succeed.\\nMethinks already from this chemic flame,\\nI see a city of more precious mould:\\nRich as the town which gives the Indies name,\\nWith silver paved, and all divine with gold.\\nAlready labouring with a mighty fate,\\nShe shakes the rubbish from her mounting brow,\\nAnd seems to have renew'd her charter's date,\\nWhich Heaven will to the death of time allow.\\nMore great than human now, and more august,\\nNow deified she from her fires does rise:\\nHer widening streets on new foundations trust,\\nAnd opening into larger parts she flies.\\nBefore, she like some shepherdess did show,\\nWho sat to bathe her by a river's side;\\nNot answering to her fame, but rude and low,\\nNor taught the beauteous arts of modern pride.\\nNow, like a maiden queen, she will behold,\\nFrom her high turrets, hourly suitors come;\\nThe East with incense, and the West with gold,\\nWill stand, like suppliants, to receive her doom!\\nThe silver Thames, her own domestic flood,\\nShall bear her vessels like a sweeping train;\\nAnd often wind, as of his mistress proud,\\nWith longing eyes to meet her face again.\\nThe wealthy Tagus, and the wealthier Rhine,\\nThe glory of their towns no more shall boast;\\nAnd Seine, that would with Belgian rivers join,\\nShall find her lustre stain'd, and traffic lost.\\nThe venturous merchant who design'd more far,\\nAnd touches on our hospitable shore,\\nCharm'd with the splendour of this northern star,\\nShall here unlade him, and depart no more.\\nOur powerful navy shall no longer meet,\\nThe wealth of France or Holland to invade;\\nThe beauty of this town without a fleet,\\nFrom all the world shall vindicate her trade.\\nAnd while this famed emporium we prepare,\\nThe British ocean shall such triumphs boast,\\nThat those, who now disdain our trade to share,\\nShall rob like pirates on our wealthy coast.\\nAlready we have conquer'd half the war,\\nAnd the less dangerous part is left behind:\\nOur trouble now is but to make them dare,\\nAnd not so great to vanquish as to find.\\nThus to the Eastern wealth through storms we go,\\nBut now, the Cape once doubled, fear no more;\\nA constant trade-wind will securely blow,\\nAnd gently lay us on the spicy shore.\\n\\nHow dull, and how insensible a beast\\nIs man, who yet would lord it o'er the rest!\\nPhilosophers and poets vainly strove\\nIn every age the lumpish mass to move:\\nBut those were pedants, when compared with these,\\nWho know not only to instruct, but please.\\nPoets alone found the delightful way,\\nMysterious morals gently to convey\\nIn charming numbers; so that as men grew\\nPleased with their poems, they grew wiser too.                      \\nSatire has always shone among the rest,\\nAnd is the boldest way, if not the best,\\nTo tell men freely of their foulest faults;\\nTo laugh at their vain deeds, and vainer thoughts.\\nIn satire too the wise took different ways,\\nTo each deserving its peculiar praise.\\nSome did all folly with just sharpness blame,\\nWhilst others laugh'd and scorn'd them into shame.\\nBut of these two, the last succeeded best,\\nAs men aim rightest when they shoot in jest.                        \\nYet, if we may presume to blame our guides,\\nAnd censure those who censure all besides,\\nIn other things they justly are preferr'd.\\nIn this alone methinks the ancients err'd,--\\nAgainst the grossest follies they declaim;\\nHard they pursue, but hunt ignoble game.\\nNothing is easier than such blots to hit,\\nAnd 'tis the talent of each vulgar wit:\\nBesides, 'tis labour lost; for who would preach\\nMorals to Armstrong, or dull Aston teach?                       \\n'Tis being devout at play, wise at a ball,\\nOr bringing wit and friendship to Whitehall.\\nBut with sharp eyes those nicer faults to find,\\nWhich lie obscurely in the wisest mind;\\nThat little speck which all the rest does spoil,\\nTo wash off that would be a noble toil;\\nBeyond the loose writ libels of this age,\\nOr the forced scenes of our declining stage;\\nAbove all censure too, each little wit\\nWill be so glad to see the greater hit;                             \\nWho, judging better, though concern'd the most,\\nOf such correction, will have cause to boast.\\nIn such a satire all would seek a share,\\nAnd every fool will fancy he is there.\\nOld story-tellers too must pine and die,\\nTo see their antiquated wit laid by;\\nLike her, who miss'd her name in a lampoon,\\nAnd grieved to find herself decay'd so soon.\\nNo common coxcomb must be mentioned here:\\nNot the dull train of dancing sparks appear;                        \\nNor fluttering officers who never fight;\\nOf such a wretched rabble who would write?\\nMuch less half wits: that's more against our rules;\\nFor they are fops, the other are but fools.\\nWho would not be as silly as Dunbar?\\nAs dull as Monmouth, rather than Sir Carr?\\nThe cunning courtier should be slighted too,\\nWho with dull knavery makes so much ado;\\nTill the shrewd fool, by thriving too, too fast,\\nLike Ã†sop's fox becomes a prey at last.                             \\nNor shall the royal mistresses be named,\\nToo ugly, or too easy to be blamed,\\nWith whom each rhyming fool keeps such a pother,\\nThey are as common that way as the other:\\nYet sauntering Charles, between his beastly brace,\\nMeets with dissembling still in either place,\\nAffected humour, or a painted face.\\nIn loyal libels we have often told him,\\nHow one has jilted him, the other sold him:\\nHow that affects to laugh, how this to weep;                        \\nBut who can rail so long as he can sleep?\\nWas ever prince by two at once misled,\\nFalse, foolish, old, ill-natured, and ill-bred?\\nEarnely and Aylesbury with all that race\\nOf busy blockheads, shall have here no place;\\nAt council set as foils on Danby's score,\\nTo make that great false jewel shine the more;\\nWho all that while was thought exceeding wise,\\nOnly for taking pains and telling lies.\\nBut there's no meddling with such nauseous men;                     \\nTheir very names have tired my lazy pen:\\n'Tis time to quit their company, and choose\\nSome fitter subject for sharper muse.\\nFirst, let's behold the merriest man alive\\nAgainst his careless genius vainly strive;\\nQuit his dear ease, some deep design to lay,\\n'Gainst a set time, and then forget the day:\\nYet he will laugh at his best friends, and be\\nJust as good company as Nokes and Lee.\\nBut when he aims at reason or at rule,                              \\nHe turns himself the best to ridicule;\\nLet him at business ne'er so earnest sit,\\nShow him but mirth, and bait that mirth with wit;\\nThat shadow of a jest shall be enjoy'd,\\nThough he left all mankind to be destroy'd.\\nSo cat transform'd sat gravely and demure,\\nTill mouse appear'd, and thought himself secure;\\nBut soon the lady had him in her eye,\\nAnd from her friend did just as oddly fly.\\nReaching above our nature does no good;                            \\nWe must fall back to our old flesh and blood;\\nAs by our little Machiavel we find\\nThat nimblest creature of the busy kind,\\nHis limbs are crippled, and his body shakes;\\nYet his hard mind which all this bustle makes,\\nNo pity of its poor companion takes.\\nWhat gravity can hold from laughing out,\\nTo see him drag his feeble legs about,\\nLike hounds ill-coupled? Jowler lugs him still\\nThrough hedges, ditches, and through all that's ill.               \\n'Twere crime in any man but him alone,\\nTo use a body so, though 'tis one's own:\\nYet this false comfort never gives him o'er,\\nThat whilst he creeps his vigorous thoughts can soar;\\nAlas! that soaring to those few that know,\\nIs but a busy grovelling here below.\\nSo men in rapture think they mount the sky,\\nWhilst on the ground the entranced wretches lie:\\nSo modern fops have fancied they could fly.\\nAs the new earl, with parts deserving praise,                  \\nAnd wit enough to laugh at his own ways,\\nYet loses all soft days and sensual nights,\\nKind nature checks, and kinder fortune slights;\\nStriving against his quiet all he can,\\nFor the fine notion of a busy man.\\nAnd what is that at best, but one whose mind\\nIs made to tire himself and all mankind?\\nFor Ireland he would go; faith, let him reign;\\nFor if some odd, fantastic lord would fain\\nCarry in trunks, and all my drudgery do,                           \\nI'll not only pay him, but admire him too.\\nBut is there any other beast that lives,\\nWho his own harm so wittingly contrives?\\nWill any dog that has his teeth and stones,\\nRefinedly leave his bitches and his bones,\\nTo turn a wheel, and bark to be employ'd,\\nWhile Venus is by rival dogs enjoy'd?\\nYet this fond man, to get a statesman's name,\\nForfeits his friends, his freedom, and his fame.\\nThough satire, nicely writ, with humour stings                   \\nBut those who merit praise in other things;\\nYet we must needs this one exception make,\\nAnd break our rules for silly Tropos' sake;\\nWho was too much despised to be accused,\\nAnd therefore scarce deserves to be abused;\\nRaised only by his mercenary tongue,\\nFor railing smoothly, and for reasoning wrong,\\nAs boys, on holidays, let loose to play,\\nLay waggish traps for girls that pass that way;\\nThen shout to see in dirt and deep distress                        \\nSome silly cit in her flower'd foolish dress:\\nSo have I mighty satisfaction found,\\nTo see his tinsel reason on the ground:\\nTo see the florid fool despised, and know it,\\nBy some who scarce have words enough to show it:\\nFor sense sits silent, and condemns for weaker\\nThe finer, nay sometimes the wittier speaker:\\nBut 'tis prodigious so much eloquence\\nShould be acquirÃ¨d by such little sense;\\nFor words and wit did anciently agree,                             \\nAnd Tully was no fool, though this man be:\\nAt bar abusive, on the bench unable,\\nKnave on the woolsack, fop at council-table.\\nThese are the grievances of such fools as would\\nBe rather wise than honest, great than good.\\nSome other kind of wits must be made known,\\nWhose harmless errors hurt themselves alone;\\nExcess of luxury they think can please,\\nAnd laziness call loving of their ease:\\nTo live dissolved in pleasures still they feign,                   \\nThough their whole life's but intermitting pain:\\nSo much of surfeits, headaches, claps are seen,\\nWe scarce perceive the little time between:\\nWell-meaning men who make this gross mistake,\\nAnd pleasure lose only for pleasure's sake;\\nEach pleasure has its price, and when we pay\\nToo much of pain, we squander life away.\\nThus Dorset, purring like a thoughtful cat,\\nMarried, but wiser puss ne'er thought of that:\\nAnd first he worried her with railing rhyme,                       \\nLike Pembroke's mastives at his kindest time;\\nThen for one night sold all his slavish life,\\nA teeming widow, but a barren wife;\\nSwell'd by contact of such a fulsome toad,\\nHe lugg'd about the matrimonial load;\\nTill fortune, blindly kind as well as he,\\nHas ill restored him to his liberty;\\nWhich he would use in his old sneaking way,\\nDrinking all night, and dozing all the day;\\nDull as Ned Howard, whom his brisker times                     \\nHad famed for dulness in malicious rhymes.\\nMulgrave had much ado to 'scape the snare,\\nThough learn'd in all those arts that cheat the fair:\\nFor after all his vulgar marriage mocks,\\nWith beauty dazzled, Numps was in the stocks;\\nDeluded parents dried their weeping eyes,\\nTo see him catch his Tartar for his prize;\\nThe impatient town waited the wish'd-for change,\\nAnd cuckolds smiled in hopes of sweet revenge;\\nTill Petworth plot made us with sorrow see,                        \\nAs his estate, his person too was free:\\nHim no soft thoughts, no gratitude could move;\\nTo gold he fled from beauty and from love;\\nYet, failing there, he keeps his freedom still,\\nForced to live happily against his will:\\n'Tis not his fault, if too much wealth and power\\nBreak not his boasted quiet every hour.\\nAnd little Sid, for simile renown'd,\\nPleasure has always sought but never found:\\nThough all his thoughts on wine and women fall,                    \\nHis are so bad, sure he ne'er thinks at all.\\nThe flesh he lives upon is rank and strong,\\nHis meat and mistresses are kept too long.\\nBut sure we all mistake this pious man,\\nWho mortifies his person all he can:\\nWhat we uncharitably take for sin,\\nAre only rules of this odd capuchin;\\nFor never hermit under grave pretence,\\nHas lived more contrary to common sense;\\nAnd 'tis a miracle we may suppose,                                 \\nNo nastiness offends his skilful nose:\\nWhich from all stink can with peculiar art\\nExtract perfume and essence from a f--t.\\nExpecting supper is his great delight;\\nHe toils all day but to be drunk at night:\\nThen o'er his cups this night-bird chirping sits,\\nTill he takes Hewet and Jack Hall for wits.\\nRochester I despise for want of wit,\\nThough thought to have a tail and cloven feet;\\nFor while he mischief means to all mankind,                        \\nHimself alone the ill effects does find:\\nAnd so like witches justly suffer shame,\\nWhose harmless malice is so much the same.\\nFalse are his words, affected is his wit;\\nSo often he does aim, so seldom hit;\\nTo every face he cringes while he speaks,\\nBut when the back is turn'd, the head he breaks:\\nMean in each action, lewd in every limb,\\nManners themselves are mischievous in him:\\nA proof that chance alone makes every creature,                    \\nA very Killigrew without good nature.\\nFor what a Bessus has he always lived,\\nAnd his own kickings notably contrived!\\nFor, there's the folly that's still mix'd with fear,\\nCowards more blows than any hero bear;\\nOf fighting sparks some may their pleasures say,\\nBut 'tis a bolder thing to run away:\\nThe world may well forgive him all his ill,\\nFor every fault does prove his penance still:\\nFalsely he falls into some dangerous noose,                        \\nAnd then as meanly labours to get loose;\\nA life so infamous is better quitting,\\nSpent in base injury and low submitting.\\nI'd like to have left out his poetry;\\nForgot by all almost as well as me.\\nSometimes he has some humour, never wit,\\nAnd if it rarely, very rarely, hit,\\n'Tis under so much nasty rubbish laid,\\nTo find it out's the cinderwoman's trade;\\nWho for the wretched remnants of a fire,                           \\nMust toil all day in ashes and in mire.\\nSo lewdly dull his idle works appear,\\nThe wretched texts deserve no comments here;\\nWhere one poor thought sometimes, left all alone,\\nFor a whole page of dulness must atone.\\nHow vain a thing is man, and how unwise!\\nEven he, who would himself the most despise!\\nI, who so wise and humble seem to be,\\nNow my own vanity and pride can't see;\\nWhile the world's nonsense is so sharply shown,                    \\nWe pull down others' but to raise our own;\\nThat we may angels seem, we paint them elves,\\nAnd are but satires to set up ourselves.\\nI, who have all this while been finding fault,\\nEven with my master, who first satire taught;\\nAnd did by that describe the task so hard,\\nIt seems stupendous and above reward;\\nNow labour with unequal force to climb\\nThat lofty hill, unreach'd by former time;\\n'Tis just that I should to the bottom fall,                        \\nLearn to write well, or not to write at all.\\n\\nIn pious times, ere priestcraft did begin,\\nBefore polygamy was made a sin;\\nWhen man on many multiplied his kind,\\nEre one to one was cursedly confined;\\nWhen nature prompted, and no law denied\\nPromiscuous use of concubine and bride;\\nThen Israel's monarch after Heaven's own heart,\\nHis vigorous warmth did variously impart\\nTo wives and slaves; and wide as his command,\\nScatter'd his Maker's image through the land.                       \\nMichal, of royal blood, the crown did wear;\\nA soil ungrateful to the tiller's care:\\nNot so the rest; for several mothers bore\\nTo god-like David several sons before.\\nBut since like slaves his bed they did ascend,\\nNo true succession could their seed attend.\\nOf all the numerous progeny was none\\nSo beautiful, so brave, as Absalom:\\nWhether inspired by some diviner lust,\\nHis father got him with a greater gust;                             \\nOr that his conscious destiny made way,\\nBy manly beauty to imperial sway.\\nEarly in foreign fields he won renown,\\nWith kings and states allied to Israel's crown:\\nIn peace the thoughts of war he could remove,\\nAnd seem'd as he were only born for love.\\nWhate'er he did, was done with so much ease,\\nIn him alone 'twas natural to please:\\nHis motions all accompanied with grace;\\nAnd Paradise was open'd in his face.                                \\nWith secret joy indulgent David view'd\\nHis youthful image in his son renew'd:\\nTo all his wishes nothing he denied;\\nAnd made the charming Annabell his bride.\\nWhat faults he had (for who from faults is free?)\\nHis father could not, or he would not see.\\nSome warm excesses which the law forbore,\\nWere construed youth that purged by boiling o'er;\\nAnd Amnon's murder by a specious name,\\nWas call'd a just revenge for injured fame.                         \\nThus praised and loved, the noble youth remain'd,\\nWhile David undisturb'd in Sion reign'd.\\nBut life can never be sincerely blest:\\nHeaven punishes the bad, and proves the best.\\nThe Jews, a headstrong, moody, murmuring race,\\nAs ever tried the extent and stretch of grace;\\nGod's pamper'd people, whom, debauch'd with ease,\\nNo king could govern, nor no god could please;\\n(Gods they had tried of every shape and size,\\nThat god-smiths could produce, or priests devise):                  \\nThese Adam-wits, too fortunately free,\\nBegan to dream they wanted liberty;\\nAnd when no rule, no precedent was found,\\nOf men by laws less circumscribed and bound;\\nThey led their wild desires to woods and caves,\\nAnd thought that all but savages were slaves.\\nThey who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,\\nMade foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego;\\nWho banish'd David did from Hebron bring,\\nAnd with a general shout proclaim'd him king:                       \\nThose very Jews, who, at their very best,\\nTheir humour more than loyalty express'd,\\nNow wonder'd why so long they had obey'd\\nAn idol monarch, which their hands had made;\\nThought they might ruin him they could create,\\nOr melt him to that golden calf--a state.\\nBut these were random bolts: no form'd design,\\nNor interest made the factious crowd to join:\\nThe sober part of Israel, free from stain,\\nWell knew the value of a peaceful reign;                            \\nAnd, looking backward with a wise affright,\\nSaw seams of wounds dishonest to the sight:\\nIn contemplation of whose ugly scars,\\nThey cursed the memory of civil wars.\\nThe moderate sort of men thus qualified,\\nInclined the balance to the better side;\\nAnd David's mildness managed it so well,\\nThe bad found no occasion to rebel.\\nBut when to sin our biass'd nature leans,\\nThe careful devil is still at hand with means;                      \\nAnd providently pimps for ill desires:\\nThe good old cause revived a plot requires.\\nPlots, true or false, are necessary things,\\nTo raise up commonwealths, and ruin kings.\\nThe inhabitants of old Jerusalem\\nWere Jebusites; the town so call'd from them;\\nAnd theirs the native right--\\nBut when the chosen people grew more strong,\\nThe rightful cause at length became the wrong;\\nAnd every loss the men of Jebus bore,                               \\nThey still were thought God's enemies the more.\\nThus worn or weaken'd, well or ill content,\\nSubmit they must to David's government:\\nImpoverish'd and deprived of all command,\\nTheir taxes doubled as they lost their land;\\nAnd, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,\\nTheir gods disgraced, and burnt like common wood.\\nThis set the heathen priesthood in a flame;\\nFor priests of all religions are the same.\\nOf whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,                            \\nStock, stone, or other homely pedigree,\\nIn his defence his servants are as bold,\\nAs if he had been born of beaten gold.\\nThe Jewish rabbins, though their enemies,\\nIn this conclude them honest men and wise:\\nFor 'twas their duty, all the learned think,\\nTo espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.\\nFrom hence began that Plot, the nation's curse,\\nBad in itself, but represented worse;\\nRaised in extremes, and in extremes decried:                       \\nWith oaths affirm'd, with dying vows denied;\\nNot weigh'd nor winnow'd by the multitude;\\nBut swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude.\\nSome truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies,\\nTo please the fools, and puzzle all the wise.\\nSucceeding times did equal folly call,\\nBelieving nothing, or believing all.\\nThe Egyptian rites the Jebusites embraced,\\nWhere gods were recommended by their taste.\\nSuch savoury deities must needs be good,                           \\nAs served at once for worship and for food.\\nBy force they could not introduce these gods;\\nFor ten to one in former days was odds.\\nSo fraud was used, the sacrificer's trade:\\nFools are more hard to conquer than persuade.\\nTheir busy teachers mingled with the Jews,\\nAnd raked for converts even the court and stews:\\nWhich Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,\\nBecause the fleece accompanies the flock,\\nSome thought they God's anointed meant to slay                     \\nBy guns, invented since full many a day:\\nOur author swears it not; but who can know\\nHow far the devil and Jebusites may go?\\nThis Plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,\\nHad yet a deep and dangerous consequence:\\nFor as, when raging fevers boil the blood,\\nThe standing lake soon floats into a flood,\\nAnd every hostile humour, which before\\nSlept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er;\\nSo several factions from this first ferment,                       \\nWork up to foam, and threat the government.\\nSome by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,\\nOpposed the power to which they could not rise.\\nSome had in courts been great, and, thrown from thence,\\nLike fiends were harden'd in impenitence.\\nSome, by their monarch's fatal mercy, grown,\\nFrom pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne,\\nWere raised in power and public office high;\\nStrong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie.\\nOf these, the false Achitophel was first;                        \\nA name to all succeeding ages cursed:\\nFor close designs, and crooked counsels fit;\\nSagacious, bold, and turbulent of wit;\\nRestless, unfix'd in principles and place;\\nIn power unpleased, impatient of disgrace:\\nA fiery soul, which, working out its way,\\nFretted the pigmy body to decay,\\nAnd o'er-inform'd the tenement of clay.\\nA daring pilot in extremity;\\nPleased with the danger, when the waves went high,                 \\nHe sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,\\nWould steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.\\nGreat wits are sure to madness near allied,\\nAnd thin partitions do their bounds divide;\\nElse why should he, with wealth and honour blest,\\nRefuse his age the needful hours of rest?\\nPunish a body which he could not please;\\nBankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?\\nAnd all to leave what with his toil he won,\\nTo that unfeather'd two-legg'd thing, a son;                       \\nGot, while his soul did huddled notions try;\\nAnd born a shapeless lump, like anarchy.\\nIn friendship false, implacable in hate;\\nResolved to ruin, or to rule the state.\\nTo compass this, the triple bond he broke;\\nThe pillars of the public safety shook;\\nAnd fitted Israel for a foreign yoke:\\nThen seized with fear, yet still affecting fame,\\nUsurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.\\nSo easy still it proves, in factious times,                        \\nWith public zeal to cancel private crimes!\\nHow safe is treason, and how sacred ill,\\nWhere none can sin against the people's will!\\nWhere crowds can wink, and no offence be known,\\nSince in another's guilt they find their own!\\nYet fame deserved no enemy can grudge;\\nThe statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.\\nIn Israel's courts ne'er sat an Abethdin\\nWith more discerning eyes, or hands more clean,\\nUnbribed, unsought, the wretched to redress;                       \\nSwift of despatch, and easy of access.\\nOh! had he been content to serve the crown,\\nWith virtues only proper to the gown;\\nOr had the rankness of the soil been freed\\nFrom cockle, that oppress'd the noble seed;\\nDavid for him his tuneful harp had strung,\\nAnd Heaven had wanted one immortal song.\\nBut wild ambition loves to slide, not stand,\\nAnd fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land.\\nAchitophel, grown weary to possess                                 \\nA lawful fame, and lazy happiness,\\nDisdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,\\nAnd lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.\\nNow, manifest of crimes contrived long since,\\nHe stood at bold defiance with his prince;\\nHeld up the buckler of the people's cause\\nAgainst the crown, and skulk'd behind the laws.\\nThe wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;\\nSome circumstances finds, but more he makes;\\nBy buzzing emissaries fills the ears                               \\nOf listening crowds with jealousies and fears\\nOf arbitrary counsels brought to light,\\nAnd proves the king himself a Jebusite.\\nWeak arguments! which yet he knew full well\\nWere strong with people easy to rebel.\\nFor, govern'd by the moon, the giddy Jews\\nTread the same track, when she the prime renews;\\nAnd once in twenty years, their scribes record,\\nBy natural instinct they change their lord.\\nAchitophel still wants a chief, and none                           \\nWas found so fit as warlike Absalom.\\nNot that he wish'd his greatness to create,\\nFor politicians neither love nor hate:\\nBut, for he knew his title not allow'd,\\nWould keep him still depending on the crowd:\\nThat kingly power, thus ebbing out, might be\\nDrawn to the dregs of a democracy.\\nHim he attempts with studied arts to please,\\nAnd sheds his venom in such words as these:\\nAuspicious prince! at whose nativity                             \\nSome royal planet ruled the southern sky;\\nThy longing country's darling and desire;\\nTheir cloudy pillar and their guardian fire:\\nTheir second Moses, whose extended wand\\nDivides the seas, and shows the promised land:\\nWhose dawning day, in every distant age,\\nHas exercised the sacred prophet's rage:\\nThe people's prayer, the glad diviner's theme,\\nThe young men's vision, and the old men's dream!\\nThee, Saviour, thee the nation's vows confess,                     \\nAnd, never satisfied with seeing, bless:\\nSwift, unbespoken pomps thy steps proclaim,\\nAnd stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.\\nHow long wilt thou the general joy detain,\\nStarve and defraud the people of thy reign!\\nContent ingloriously to pass thy days,\\nLike one of virtue's fools that feed on praise;\\nTill thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,\\nGrow stale, and tarnish with our daily sight?\\nBelieve me, royal youth, thy fruit must be                         \\nOr gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree.\\nHeaven has to all allotted, soon or late,\\nSome lucky revolution of their fate:\\nWhose motions, if we watch and guide with skill,\\n(For human good depends on human will,)\\nOur fortune rolls as from a smooth descent,\\nAnd from the first impression takes the bent:\\nBut if, unseized, she glides away like wind,\\nAnd leaves repenting folly far behind.\\nNow, now she meets you with a glorious prize,                      \\nAnd spreads her locks before her as she flies.\\nHad thus old David, from whose loins you spring,\\nNot dared when fortune called him to be king,\\nAt Gath an exile he might still remain,\\nAnd Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.\\nLet his successful youth your hopes engage;\\nBut shun the example of declining age:\\nBehold him setting in his western skies,\\nThe shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.\\nHe is not now, as when on Jordan's sand                            \\nThe joyful people throng'd to see him land,\", \"Covering the beach and blackening all the strand;\\nBut, like the prince of angels, from his height\\nComes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:\\nBetray'd by one poor Plot to public scorn:\\n(Our only blessing since his cursed return:)\\nThose heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,\\nBlown off and scatter'd by a puff of wind.\\nWhat strength can he to your designs oppose,\\nNaked of friends, and round beset with foes?                       \\nIf Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,\\nA foreign aid would more incense the Jews:\\nProud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;\\nFoment the war, but not support the king:\\nNor would the royal party e'er unite\\nWith Pharaoh's arms to assist the Jebusite;\\nOr if they should, their interest soon would break,\\nAnd with such odious aid make David weak.\\nAll sorts of men, by my successful arts,\\nAbhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts                     \\nFrom David's rule: and 'tis their general cry--\\nReligion, commonwealth, and liberty.\\nIf you, as champion of the public good,\\nAdd to their arms a chief of royal blood,\\nWhat may not Israel hope, and what applause\\nMight such a general gain by such a cause?\\nNot barren praise alone--that gaudy flower,\\nFair only to the sight--but solid power:\\nAnd nobler is a limited command,\\nGiven by the love of all your native land,                         \\nThan a successive title, long and dark,\\nDrawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's ark.\\nWhat cannot praise effect in mighty minds,\\nWhen flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds?\\nDesire of power, on earth a vicious weed,\\nYet sprung from high, is of celestial seed:\\nIn God 'tis glory; and when men aspire,\\n'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.\\nThe ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,\\nToo full of angels' metal in his frame,                            \\nUnwarily was led from virtue's ways,\\nMade drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise.\\nHalf loath, and half consenting to the ill,\\nFor royal blood within him struggled still,\\nHe thus replied:--And what pretence have I\\nTo take up arms for public liberty?\\nMy father governs with unquestion'd right,\\nThe faith's defender, and mankind's delight;\\nGood, gracious, just, observant of the laws;\\nAnd Heaven by wonders has espoused his cause.                      \\nWhom has he wrong'd, in all his peaceful reign?\\nWho sues for justice to his throne in vain?\\nWhat millions has he pardon'd of his foes,\\nWhom just revenge did to his wrath expose!\\nMild, easy, humble, studious of our good;\\nInclined to mercy, and averse from blood.\\nIf mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,\\nHis crime is God's beloved attribute.\\nWhat could he gain his people to betray,\\nOr change his right for arbitrary sway?                            \\nLet haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign\\nHis fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train.\\nIf David's rule Jerusalem displease,\\nThe dog-star heats their brains to this disease.\\nWhy then should I, encouraging the bad,\\nTurn rebel and run popularly mad?\\nWere he a tyrant, who by lawless might\\nOppress'd the Jews, and raised the Jebusite,\\nWell might I mourn; but nature's holy bands\\nWould curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:                      \\nThe people might assert their liberty;\\nBut what was right in them were crime in me.\\nHis favour leaves me nothing to require,\\nPrevents my wishes, and outruns desire.\\nWhat more can I expect while David lives?\\nAll but his kingly diadem he gives:\\nAnd that--But here he paused; then, sighing, said--\\nIs justly destined for a worthier head.\\nFor when my father from his toils shall rest,\\nAnd late augment the number of the blest,                          \\nHis lawful issue shall the throne ascend,\\nOr the collateral line, where that shall end.\\nHis brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,\\nYet dauntless, and secure of native right,\\nOf every royal virtue stands possess'd;\\nStill dear to all the bravest and the best.\\nHis courage foes--his friends his truth proclaim;\\nHis loyalty the king--the world his fame.\\nHis mercy even the offending crowd will find;\\nFor sure he comes of a forgiving kind.                             \\nWhy should I then repine at Heaven's decree,\\nWhich gives me no pretence to royalty?\\nYet, oh! that fate, propitiously inclined,\\nHad raised my birth, or had debased my mind;\\nTo my large soul not all her treasure lent,\\nAnd then betray'd it to a mean descent!\\nI find, I find my mounting spirits bold,\\nAnd David's part disdains my mother's mould.\\nWhy am I scanted by a niggard birth?\\nMy soul disclaims the kindred of her earth;                        \\nAnd, made for empire, whispers me within,\\nDesire of greatness is a god-like sin.\\nHim staggering so, when hell's dire agent found,\\nWhile fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground,\\nHe pours fresh forces in, and thus replies:\\nThe eternal God, supremely good and wise,\\nImparts not these prodigious gifts in vain;\\nWhat wonders are reserved to bless your reign!\\nAgainst your will your arguments have shown,\\nSuch virtue's only given to guide a throne.                        \\nNot that your father's mildness I contemn;\\nBut manly force becomes the diadem.\\n'Tis true he grants the people all they crave;\\nAnd more perhaps than subjects ought to have:\\nFor lavish grants suppose a monarch tame,\\nAnd more his goodness than his wit proclaim.\\nBut when should people strive their bonds to break,\\nIf not when kings are negligent or weak?\\nLet him give on till he can give no more,\\nThe thrifty Sanhedrim shall keep him poor;                         \\nAnd every shekel which he can receive,\\nShall cost a limb of his prerogative.\\nTo ply him with new plots shall be my care;\\nOr plunge him deep in some expensive war;\\nWhich, when his treasure can no more supply,\\nHe must with the remains of kingship buy\\nHis faithful friends, our jealousies and fears\\nCall Jebusites, and Pharaoh's pensioners;\\nWhom when our fury from his aid has torn,\\nHe shall be naked left to public scorn.                            \\nThe next successor, whom I fear and hate,\\nMy arts have made obnoxious to the state;\\nTurn'd all his virtues to his overthrow,\\nAnd gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe.\\nHis right, for sums of necessary gold,\\nShall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold;\\nTill time shall ever-wanting David draw,\\nTo pass your doubtful title into law;\\nIf not, the people have a right supreme\\nTo make their kings, for kings are made for them.                  \\nAll empire is no more than power in trust,\\nWhich, when resumed, can be no longer just.\\nSuccession, for the general good design'd,\\nIn its own wrong a nation cannot bind:\\nIf altering that the people can relieve,\\nBetter one suffer than a nation grieve.\\nThe Jews well know their power: ere Saul they chose,\\nGod was their king, and God they durst depose.\\nUrge now your piety, your filial name,\\nA father's right, and fear of future fame;                         \\nThe public good, that universal call,\\nTo which even Heaven submitted, answers all.\\nNor let his love enchant your generous mind;\\n'Tis nature's trick to propagate her kind.\\nOur fond begetters, who would never die,\\nLove but themselves in their posterity.\\nOr let his kindness by the effects be tried,\\nOr let him lay his vain pretence aside.\\nGod said, he loved your father; could he bring\\nA better proof, than to anoint him king?                           \\nIt surely show'd he loved the shepherd well,\\nWho gave so fair a flock as Israel.\\nWould David have you thought his darling son?\\nWhat means he then to alienate the crown?\\nThe name of godly he may blush to bear:\\nIs't after God's own heart to cheat his heir?\\nHe to his brother gives supreme command,\\nTo you a legacy of barren land;\\nPerhaps the old harp, on which he thrums his lays,\\nOr some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.                         \\nThen the next heir, a prince severe and wise,\\nAlready looks on you with jealous eyes;\\nSees through the thin disguises of your arts,\\nAnd marks your progress in the people's hearts;\\nThough now his mighty soul its grief contains:\\nHe meditates revenge who least complains;\\nAnd like a lion, slumbering in the way,\\nOr sleep dissembling, while he waits his prey,\\nHis fearless foes within his distance draws,\\nConstrains his roaring, and contracts his paws;                    \\nTill at the last his time for fury found,\\nHe shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground;\\nThe prostrate vulgar passes o'er and spares,\\nBut with a lordly rage his hunters tears.\\nYour case no tame expedients will afford:\\nResolve on death, or conquest by the sword,\\nWhich for no less a stake than life you draw;\\nAnd self-defence is nature's eldest law.\\nLeave the warm people no considering time:\\nFor then rebellion may be thought a crime.                         \\nAvail yourself of what occasion gives,\\nBut try your title while your father lives:\\nAnd that your arms may have a fair pretence,\\nProclaim you take them in the king's defence;\\nWhose sacred life each minute would expose\\nTo plots, from seeming friends, and secret foes.\\nAnd who can sound the depth of David's soul?\\nPerhaps his fear, his kindness may control.\\nHe fears his brother, though he loves his son,\\nFor plighted vows too late to be undone.                           \\nIf so, by force he wishes to be gain'd:\\nBy women's lechery to seem constrain'd.\\nDoubt not; but, when he most affects the frown,\\nCommit a pleasing rape upon the crown.\\nSecure his person to secure your cause:\\nThey who possess the prince possess the laws.\\nHe said, and this advice above the rest,\\nWith Absalom's mild nature suited best;\\nUnblamed of life, ambition set aside,\\nNot stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride,                   \\nHow happy had he been, if destiny\\nHad higher placed his birth, or not so high!\\nHis kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne,\\nAnd bless'd all other countries but his own.\\nBut charming greatness since so few refuse,\\n'Tis juster to lament him than accuse.\\nStrong were his hopes a rival to remove,\\nWith blandishments to gain the public love:\\nTo head the faction while their zeal was hot,\\nAnd popularly prosecute the Plot.                                  \\nTo further this, Achitophel unites\\nThe malcontents of all the Israelites:\\nWhose differing parties he could wisely join,\\nFor several ends to serve the same design.\\nThe best--and of the princes some were such--\\nWho thought the power of monarchy too much;\\nMistaken men, and patriots in their hearts;\\nNot wicked, but seduced by impious arts.\\nBy these the springs of property were bent,\\nAnd wound so high, they crack'd the government.                    \\nThe next for interest sought to embroil the state,\\nTo sell their duty at a dearer rate,\\nAnd make their Jewish markets of the throne;\\nPretending public good, to serve their own.\\nOthers thought kings an useless heavy load,\\nWho cost too much, and did too little good.\\nThese were for laying honest David by,\\nOn principles of pure good husbandry.\\nWith them join'd all the haranguers of the throng,\\nThat thought to get preferment by the tongue.                      \\nWho follow next a double danger bring,\\nNot only hating David, but the king;\\nThe Solyimaean rout; well versed of old\\nIn godly faction, and in treason bold;\\nCowering and quaking at a conqueror's sword,\\nBut lofty to a lawful prince restored;\\nSaw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun,\\nAnd scorn'd by Jebusites to be outdone.\\nHot Levites headed these; who pull'd before\\nFrom the ark, which in the Judges' days they bore,                 \\nResumed their cant, and with a zealous cry,\\nPursued their old beloved theocracy:\\nWhere Sanhedrim and priest enslaved the nation,\\nAnd justified their spoils by inspiration:\\nFor who so fit to reign as Aaron's race,\\nIf once dominion they could found in grace?\\nThese led the pack; though not of surest scent,\\nYet deepest mouth'd against the government.\\nA numerous host of dreaming saints succeed,\\nOf the true old enthusiastic breed:                                \\n'Gainst form and order they their power employ,\\nNothing to build, and all things to destroy.\\nBut far more numerous was the herd of such,\\nWho think too little, and who talk too much.\\nThese out of mere instinct, they knew not why,\\nAdored their fathers' God and property;\\nAnd by the same blind benefit of fate,\\nThe Devil and the Jebusite did hate:\\nBorn to be saved, even in their own despite,\\nBecause they could not help believing right.                       \\nSuch were the tools: but a whole Hydra more\\nRemains of sprouting heads too long to score.\\nSome of their chiefs were princes of the land:\\nIn the first rank of these did Zimri stand;\\nA man so various, that he seem'd to be\\nNot one, but all mankind's epitome:\\nStiff in opinions, always in the wrong;\\nWas everything by starts, and nothing long;\\nBut, in the course of one revolving moon,\\nWas chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:                      \\nThen all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,\\nBesides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.\\nBlest madman, who could every hour employ,\\nWith something new to wish, or to enjoy!\\nRailing and praising were his usual themes;\\nAnd both, to show his judgment, in extremes:\\nSo over violent, or over civil,\\nThat every man with him was God or Devil.\\nIn squandering wealth was his peculiar art:\\nNothing went unrewarded but desert.                                \\nBeggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late;\\nHe had his jest, and they had his estate.\\nHe laugh'd himself from court; then sought relief\\nBy forming parties, but could ne'er be chief:\\nFor, spite of him the weight of business fell\\nOn Absalom and wise Achitophel:\\nThus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,\\nHe left not faction, but of that was left.\\nTitles and names 'twere tedious to rehearse\\nOf lords, below the dignity of verse.                              \\nWits, warriors, commonwealth's-men, were the best:\\nKind husbands, and mere nobles, all the rest.\\nAnd therefore, in the name of dulness, be\\nThe well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free:\\nAnd canting Nadab let oblivion damn,\\nWho made new porridge for the paschal lamb.\\nLet friendship's holy band some names assure;\\nSome their own worth, and some let scorn secure.\\nNor shall the rascal rabble here have place,\\nWhom kings no titles gave, and God no grace:                       \\nNot bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes draw\\nTo mean rebellion, and make treason law.\\nBut he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse,\\nThe wretch who Heaven's anointed dared to curse;\\nShimei, whose youth did early promise bring\\nOf zeal to God and hatred to his king,\\nDid wisely from expensive sins refrain,\\nAnd never broke the Sabbath but for gain;\\nNor ever was he known an oath to vent,\\nOr curse, unless against the government.                           \\nThus heaping wealth by the most ready way\\nAmong the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;\\nThe city, to reward his pious hate\\nAgainst his master, chose him magistrate.\\nHis hand a vare of justice did uphold;\\nHis neck was loaded with a chain of gold.\\nDuring his office treason was no crime;\\nThe sons of Belial had a glorious time:\\nFor Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,\\nYet loved his wicked neighbour as himself.                         \\nWhen two or three were gather'd to declaim\\nAgainst the monarch of Jerusalem,\\nShimei was always in the midst of them;\\nAnd if they cursed the king when he was by,\\nWould rather curse than break good company.\\nIf any durst his factious friends accuse,\\nHe pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews;\\nWhose fellow-feeling in the godly cause\\nWould free the suffering saint from human laws.\\nFor laws are only made to punish those                             \\nWho serve the king, and to protect his foes.\\nIf any leisure time he had from power\\n(Because 'tis sin to misemploy an hour),\\nHis business was, by writing to persuade,\\nThat kings were useless and a clog to trade;\\nAnd, that his noble style he might refine,\\nNo Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wind.\\nChaste were his cellars, and his shrivel board\\nThe grossness of a city feast abhorr'd;\\nHis cooks with long disuse their trade forgot;                     \\nCool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot.\\nSuch frugal virtue malice may accuse,\\nBut sure 'twas necessary to the Jews;\\nFor towns, once burnt, such magistrates require\\nAs dare not tempt God's providence by fire.\\nWith spiritual food he fed his servants well,\\nBut free from flesh that made the Jews rebel:\\nAnd Moses' laws he held in more account,\\nFor forty days of fasting in the mount.\\nTo speak the rest who better are forgot,                           \\nWould tire a well-breathed witness of the plot.\\nYet Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass;\\nErect thyself, thou monumental brass,\\nHigh as the serpent of thy metal made,\\nWhile nations stand secure beneath thy shade.\\nWhat though his birth were base, yet comets rise\\nFrom earthly vapours, ere they shine in skies.\\nProdigious actions may as well be done\\nBy weaver's issue, as by prince's son.\\nThis arch attestor for the public good                             \\nBy that one deed ennobles all his blood.\\nWho ever ask'd the witness's high race,\\nWhose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace?\\nOurs was a Levite, and as times went then,\\nHis tribe were God Almighty's gentlemen.\\nSunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,\\nSure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud.\\nHis long chin proved his wit; his saint-like grace\\nA church vermilion, and a Moses' face.\\nHis memory miraculously great,                                     \\nCould plots, exceeding man's belief, repeat;\\nWhich therefore cannot be accounted lies,\\nFor human wit could never such devise.\\nSome future truths are mingled in his book;\\nBut where the witness fail'd, the prophet spoke.\\nSome things like visionary flights appear;\\nThe spirit caught him up the Lord knows where;\\nAnd gave him his rabbinical degree,\\nUnknown to foreign university.\\nHis judgment yet his memory did excel;                             \\nWhich pieced his wondrous evidence so well,\\nAnd suited to the temper of the times,\\nThen groaning under Jebusitic crimes.\\nLet Israel's foes suspect his heavenly call,\\nAnd rashly judge his wit apocryphal;\\nOur laws for such affronts have forfeits made;\\nHe takes his life who takes away his trade.\\nWere I myself in witness Corah's place,\\nThe wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,\\nShould whet my memory, though once forgot,                         \\nTo make him an appendix of my plot.\\nHis zeal to heaven made him his prince despise,\\nAnd load his person with indignities.\\nBut zeal peculiar privilege affords,\\nIndulging latitude to deeds and words:\\nAnd Corah might for Agag's murder call,\\nIn terms as coarse as Samuel used to Saul.\\nWhat others in his evidence did join,\\nThe best that could be had for love or coin,\\nIn Corah's own predicament will fall:                              \\nFor witness is a common name to all.\\nSurrounded thus with

surprise,\\nAnd on his goodly person feed their eyes.\\nHis joy conceal'd he sets himself to show;\\nOn each side bowing popularly low:\\nHis looks, his gestures, and his words he frames,                  \\nAnd with familiar ease repeats their names.\\nThus form'd by nature, furnish'd out with arts,\\nHe glides unfelt into their secret hearts.\\nThen, with a kind compassionating look,\\nAnd sighs, bespeaking pity ere he spoke,\\nFew words he said; but easy those and fit,\\nMore slow than Hybla-drops, and far more sweet.\\nI mourn, my countrymen, your lost estate;\\nThough far unable to prevent your fate:\\nBehold a banish'd man for your dear cause                          \\nExposed a prey to arbitrary laws!\\nYet oh! that I alone could be undone,\\nCut off from empire, and no more a son!\\nNow all your liberties a spoil are made;\\nEgypt and Tyrus intercept your trade,\\nAnd Jebusites your sacred rites invade.\\nMy father, whom with reverence yet I name,\\nCharm'd into ease, is

power against himself employs.\\nHe gives, and let him give, my right away:\\nBut why should he his own and yours betray?\\nHe, only he, can make the nation bleed,\\nAnd he alone from my revenge is freed.\\nTake then my tears (with that he wiped his eyes),\\n'Tis all the aid my present power supplies:\\nNo court-informer can these arms accuse;\\nThese arms may sons against their fathers use:                     \\nAnd 'tis my wish, the next successor's reign,\\nMay make no other Israelite complain.\\nYouth, beauty, graceful action seldom fail;\\nBut common interest always will prevail:\\nAnd

a smooth pretence\\nOf specious love, and duty to their prince.\\nReligion, and redress of grievances,\\nTwo names that always cheat, and always please,\\nAre often urged; and good king David's life\\nEndanger'd by a brother and a wife.                                \\nThus in a pageant show a plot is made;\\nAnd peace itself is war in masquerade.\\nO foolish Israel! never warn'd by

their fellow-creatures for a bribe:\\nThe guiltless victim groan\\'d for their offence;\\nAnd cruelty and blood was penitence.\\nIf sheep and oxen could atone for men,\\nAh! at how cheap a rate the rich might sin!                         \\nAnd great oppressors might Heaven\\'s wrath beguile,\\nBy offering His own creatures for a spoil!\\nDarest thou, poor worm, offend Infinity?\\nAnd must the

we sure\\nStill to be sick, till Heaven reveal the cure:                     \\nIf, then, Heaven\\'s will must needs be understood\\n(Which must, if we want cure, and Heaven be good),\\nLet all records of will reveal\\'d be shown;\\nWith Scripure all in equal balance thrown,\\nAnd our one Sacred Book will be that one.\\nProof needs not here, for whether we compare\\nThat impious, idle, superstitious ware\\nOf rites, lustrations, offerings, which before,\\nIn various ages, various countries bore,\\nWith Christian faith and virtues, we shall find                    \\nNone answering the great ends of human kind,\\nBut this one rule of life, that shows us best\\nHow God may be appeased, and mortals blest.\\nWhether from length of time its worth we draw,\\nThe word is scarce more ancient than the law:\\nHeaven\\'s early care prescribed for every age;\\nFirst, in the soul, and after, in the page.\\nOr, whether more abstractedly we look,\\nOr on the writers, or the written book,\\nWhence, but from Heaven, could men unskill\\'d in arts,              \\nIn several ages born, in several parts,\\nWeave such agreeing truths? or how, or why\\nShould all conspire to cheat us with a lie?\\nUnask\\'d their pains, ungrateful their advice,\\nStarving their gain, and martyrdom their price.\\nIf on the Book itself we cast our view,\\nConcurrent heathens prove the story true:\\nThe doctrine, miracles; which must convince,\\nFor Heaven in them appeals to human sense:\\nAnd though they prove not, they confirm the cause,                 \\nWhen what is taught agrees with Nature\\'s laws.\\nThen for the style, majestic and divine,\\nIt speaks no less than God in every line:\\nCommanding words; whose force is still the same\\nAs the first fiat that produced our frame.\\nAll faiths beside, or did by arms ascend;\\nOr, sense indulged, has made mankind their friend:\\nThis only doctrine does our lusts oppose--\\nUnfed by Nature\\'s soil, in which it grows;\\nCross to our interests, curbing sense, and sin;                    \\nOppress\\'d without, and undermined within,\\nIt thrives through pain; its own tormentors tires;\\nAnd with a stubborn patience still aspires.\\nTo what can reason such effects assign,\\nTranscending nature, but to laws divine?\\nWhich in that sacred volume are contain\\'d;\\nSufficient, clear, and for that use ordain\\'d.\\nBut stay: the Deist here will urge anew,\\nNo supernatural worship can be true:\\nBecause a general law is that alone                                \\nWhich must to all, and every where be known:\\nA style so large as not this Book can claim,\\nNor aught that bears Reveal\\'d Religion\\'s name.\\n\\'Tis said the sound of a Messiah\\'s birth\\nIs gone through all the habitable earth:\\nBut still that text must be confined alone\\nTo what was then inhabited, and known:\\nAnd what provision could from thence accrue\\nTo Indian souls, and worlds discover\\'d new?\\nIn other parts it helps, that ages past,                           \\nThe Scriptures there were known, and were embraced,\\nTill sin spread once again the shades of night:\\nWhat\\'s that to these who never saw the light?\\nOf all objections this indeed is chief\\nTo startle reason, stagger frail belief:\\nWe grant, \\'tis true, that Heaven from human sense\\nHas hid the secret paths of Providence:\\nBut boundless wisdom, boundless mercy may\\nFind even for those bewilder\\'d souls a way.\\nIf from His nature foes may pity claim,                            \\nMuch more may strangers who ne\\'er heard His name.\\nAnd though no name be for salvation known,\\nBut that of his Eternal Son alone;\\nWho knows how far transcending goodness can\\nExtend the merits of that Son to man?\\nWho knows what reasons may His mercy lead;\\nOr ignorance invincible may plead?\\nNot only charity bids hope the best,\\nBut more the great apostle has express\\'d:\\nThat if the Gentiles, whom no law inspired,                        \\nBy nature did what was by law required;\\nThey, who the written rule had never known,\\nWere to themselves both rule and law alone:\\nTo nature\\'s plain indictment they shall plead;\\nAnd by their conscience be condemn\\'d or freed.\\nMost righteous doom! because a rule reveal\\'d\\nIs none to those from whom it was conceal\\'d.\\nThen those who follow\\'d reason\\'s dictates right,\\nLived up, and lifted high their natural light;\\nWith Socrates may see their Maker\\'s face,                          \\nWhile thousand rubric-martyrs want a place.\\nNor does it balk my charity to find\\nThe Egyptian bishop of another mind:\\nFor though his creed eternal truth contains,\\n\\'Tis hard for man to doom to endless pains\\nAll who believed not all his zeal required;\\nUnless he first could prove he was inspired.\\nThen let us either think he meant to say\\nThis faith, where publish\\'d, was the only way;\\nOr else conclude that, Arius to confute,                           \\nThe good old man, too eager in dispute,\\nFlew high; and as his Christian fury rose,\\nDamn\\'d all for heretics who durst oppose.\\nThus far my charity this path has tried,\\n(A much unskilful, but well meaning guide:)\\nYet what they are, even these crude thoughts were bred\\nBy reading that which better thou hast read,\\nThy matchless author\\'s work: which thou, my friend,\\nBy well translating better dost commend;\\nThose youthful hours which, of thy equals most                     \\nIn toys have squander\\'d, or in vice have lost,\\nThose hours hast thou to nobler use employ\\'d;\\nAnd the severe delights of truth enjoy\\'d.\\nWitness this weighty book, in which appears\\nThe crabbed toil of many thoughtful years,\\nSpent by thy author, in the sifting care\\nOf Rabbins\\' old sophisticated ware\\nFrom gold divine; which he who well can sort\\nMay afterwards make algebra a sport:\\nA treasure, which if country curates buy,                          \\nThey Junius and Tremellius may defy;\\nSave pains in various readings, and translations;\\nAnd without Hebrew make most learn\\'d quotations.\\nA work so full with various learning fraught,\\nSo nicely ponder\\'d, yet so strongly wrought,\\nAs nature\\'s height and art\\'s last hand required:\\nAs much as man could compass, uninspired.\\nWhere we may see what errors have been made\\nBoth in the copiers\\' and translators\\' trade;\\nHow Jewish, Popish interests have prevail\\'d,                       \\nAnd where infallibility has fail\\'d.\\nFor some, who have his secret meaning guess\\'d,\\nHave found our author not too much a priest:\\nFor fashion-sake he seems to have recourse\\nTo Pope, and Councils, and Tradition\\'s force:\\nBut he that old traditions could subdue,\\nCould not but find the weakness of the new:\\nIf Scripture, though derived from heavenly birth,\\nHas been but carelessly preserved on earth;\\nIf God\\'s own people, who of God before                             \\nKnew what we know, and had been promised more,\\nIn fuller terms, of Heaven\\'s assisting care,\\nAnd who did neither time nor study spare,\\nTo keep this Book untainted, unperplex\\'d,\\nLet in gross errors to corrupt the text,\\nOmitted paragraphs, embroil\\'d the sense,\\nWith vain traditions stopp\\'d the gaping fence,\\nWhich every common hand pull\\'d up with ease:\\nWhat safety from such brushwood-helps as these!\\nIf written words from time are not secured,                        \\nHow can we think have oral sounds endured?\\nWhich thus transmitted, if one mouth has fail\\'d,\\nImmortal lies on ages are entail\\'d:\\nAnd that some such have been, is proved too plain,\\nIf we consider interest, church, and gain.\\nO but, says one, tradition set aside,\\nWhere can we hope for an unerring guide?\\nFor since the original Scripture has been lost,\\nAll copies disagreeing, maim\\'d the most,\\nOr Christian faith can have no certain ground,                     \\nOr truth in Church Tradition must be found.\\nSuch an omniscient Church we wish indeed:\\n\\'Twere worth both Testaments, cast in the Creed:\\nBut if this mother be a guide so sure,\\nAs can all doubts resolve, all truth secure,\\nThen her infallibility, as well\\nWhere copies are corrupt or lame, can tell;\\nRestore lost canon with as little pains,\\nAs truly explicate what still remains:\\nWhich yet no Council dare pretend to do;                           \\nUnless, like Esdras, they could write it new:\\nStrange confidence still to interpret true,\\nYet not be sure that all they have explain\\'d\\nIs in the blest original contain\\'d!\\nMore safe, and much more modest \\'tis to say,\\nGod would not leave mankind without a way:\\nAnd that the Scriptures, though not every where\\nFree from corruption, or entire, or clear,\\nAre uncorrupt, sufficient, clear, entire,\\nIn all things which our needful faith require.                     \\nIf others in the same glass better see,\\n\\'Tis for themselves they look, but not for me:\\nFor my salvation must its doom receive,\\nNot from what others, but what I believe.\\nMust all tradition then be set aside?\\nThis to affirm were ignorance or pride.\\nAre there not many points, some needful sure\\nTo saving faith, that Scripture leaves obscure?\\nWhich every sect will wrest a several way,\\nFor what one sect interprets, all sects may.                       \\nWe hold, and say we prove from Scripture plain,\\nThat Christ is God; the bold Socinian\\nFrom the same Scripture urges he\\'s but man.\\nNow, what appeal can end the important suit?\\nBoth parts talk loudly, but the rule is mute.\\nShall I speak plain, and in a nation free\\nAssume an honest layman\\'s liberty?\\nI think, according to my little skill,\\nTo my own Mother Church submitting still,\\nThat many have been saved, and many may,                           \\nWho never heard this question brought in play.\\nTh\\' unletter\\'d Christian, who believes in gross,\\nPlods on to heaven, and ne\\'er is at a loss;\\nFor the strait gate would be made straiter yet,\\nWere none admitted there but men of wit.\\nThe few by nature form\\'d, with learning fraught,\\nBorn to instruct, as others to be taught,\\nMust study well the sacred page; and see\\nWhich doctrine, this or that, does best agree\\nWith the whole tenor of the work divine:                           \\nAnd plainliest points to Heaven\\'s reveal\\'d design:\\nWhich exposition flows from genuine sense;\\nAnd which is forced by wit and eloquence.\\nNot that tradition\\'s parts are useless here,\\nWhen general, old, disinteress\\'d, and clear:\\nThat ancient Fathers thus expound the page,\\nGives Truth the reverend majesty of age:\\nConfirms its force, by biding every test;\\nFor best authority\\'s next rules are best.\\nAnd still the nearer to the spring we go,                          \\nMore limpid, more unsoil\\'d, the waters flow.\\nThus first traditions were a proof alone,\\nCould we be certain such they were, so known:\\nBut since some flaws in long descent may be,\\nThey make not truth but probability.\\nEven Arius and Pelagius durst provoke\\nTo what the centuries preceding spoke.\\nSuch difference is there in an oft-told tale:\\nBut Truth by its own sinews will prevail.\\nTradition written, therefore, more commends                        \\nAuthority, than what from voice descends:\\nAnd this, as perfect as its kind can be,\\nRolls down to us the sacred history:\\nWhich from the Universal Church received,\\nIs tried, and after for itself believed.\\nThe partial Papists would infer from hence,\\nTheir Church, in last resort, should judge the sense.\\nBut first they would assume, with wondrous art,\\nThemselves to be the whole, who are but part,\\nOf that vast frame the Church; yet grant they were                 \\nThe handers down, can they from thence infer\\nA right to interpret? or would they alone\\nWho brought the present, claim it for their own?\\nThe Book\\'s a common largess to mankind;\\nNot more for them than every man design\\'d:\\nThe welcome news is in the letter found;\\nThe carrier\\'s not commissioned to expound;\\nIt speaks itself, and what it does contain\\nIn all things needful to be known is plain.\\nIn times o\\'ergrown with rust and ignorance,                     \\nA gainful trade their clergy did advance:\\nWhen want of learning kept the laymen low,\\nAnd none but priests were authorised to know:\\nWhen what small knowledge was, in them did dwell;\\nAnd he a god, who could but read and spell:\\nThen Mother Church did mightily prevail;\\nShe parcell\\'d out the Bible by retail:\\nBut still expounded what she sold or gave;\\nTo keep it in her power to damn and save.\\nScripture was scarce, and as the market went,                      \\nPoor laymen took salvation on content;\\nAs needy men take money, good or bad:\\nGod\\'s Word they had not, but th\\' priest\\'s they had.\\nYet, whate\\'er false conveyances they made,\\nThe lawyer still was certain to be paid.\\nIn those dark times they learn\\'d their knack so well,\\nThat by long use they grew infallible.\\nAt last a knowing age began to inquire\\nIf they the Book, or that did them inspire:\\nAnd making narrower search, they found, though late,               \\nThat what they thought the priest\\'s, was their estate;\\nTaught by the will produced, the written Word,\\nHow long they had been cheated on record.\\nThen every man who saw the title fair,\\nClaim\\'d a child\\'s part, and put in for a share:\\nConsulted soberly his private good,\\nAnd saved himself as cheap as e\\'er he could.\\n\\'Tis true, my friend, (and far be flattery hence),\\nThis good had full as bad a consequence:\\nThe Book thus put in every vulgar hand,                            \\nWhich each presumed he best could understand,\\nThe common rule was made the common prey;\\nAnd at the mercy of the rabble lay.\\nThe tender page with horny fists was gall\\'d;\\nAnd he was gifted most that loudest bawl\\'d.\\nThe spirit gave the doctoral degree:\\nAnd every member of a company\\nWas of his trade, and of the Bible free.\\nPlain truths enough for needful use they found;\\nBut men would still be itching to expound:                         \\nEach was ambitious of the obscurest place,\\nNo measure ta\\'en from knowledge, all from grace.\\nStudy and pains were now no more their care;\\nTexts were explain\\'d by fasting and by prayer:\\nThis was the fruit the private spirit brought;\\nOccasion\\'d by great zeal and little thought.\\nWhile crowds unlearn\\'d, with rude devotion warm,\\nAbout the sacred viands buzz and swarm.\\nThe fly-blown text creates a crawling brood,\\nAnd turns to maggots what was meant for food.                      \\nA thousand daily sects rise up and die;\\nA thousand more the perish\\'d race supply;\\nSo all we make of Heaven\\'s discover\\'d will,\\nIs, not to have it, or to use it ill.\\nThe danger\\'s much the same; on several shelves\\nIf others wreck us, or we wreck ourselves.\\nWhat then remains, but, waiving each extreme,\\nThe tides of ignorance and pride to stem?\\nNeither so rich a treasure to forego;\\nNor proudly seek beyond our power to know:                         \\nFaith is not built on disquisitions vain;\\nThe things we must believe are few and plain:\\nBut since men will believe more than they need,\\nAnd every man will make himself a creed;\\nIn doubtful questions \\'tis the safest way\\nTo learn what unsuspected ancients say:\\nFor \\'tis not likely we should higher soar\\nIn search of heaven, than all the Church before:\\nNor can we be deceived, unless we see\\nThe Scripture and the Fathers disagree.                            \\nIf, after all, they stand suspected still,\\n(For no man\\'s faith depends upon his will):\\n\\'Tis some relief, that points not clearly known,\\nWithout much hazard may be let alone:\\nAnd after hearing what our Church can say,\\nIf still our reason runs another way,\\nThat private reason \\'tis more just to curb,\\nThan by disputes the public peace disturb.\\nFor points obscure are of small use to learn:\\nBut common quiet is mankind\\'s concern.                             \\nThus have I made my own opinions clear;\\nYet neither praise expect, nor censure fear:\\nAnd this unpolish\\'d, rugged verse I chose,\\nAs fittest for discourse, and nearest prose:\\nFor while from sacred truth I do not swerve,\\nTom Sternhold\\'s or Tom Shadwell\\'s rhymes will serve.\\n\\nThus long my grief has kept me dumb:\\nSure there\\'s a lethargy in mighty woe,\\nTears stand congeal\\'d, and cannot flow;\\nAnd the sad soul retires into her inmost room:\\nTears, for a stroke foreseen, afford relief;\\nBut, unprovided for a sudden blow,\\nLike Niobe we marble grow;\\nAnd petrify with grief.\\nOur British heaven was all serene,\\nNo threatening cloud was nigh,\\nNot the least wrinkle to deform the sky;\\nWe lived as unconcern\\'d and happily\\nAs the first age in Nature\\'s golden scene;\\nSupine amidst our flowing store,\\nWe slept securely, and we dreamt of more:\\nWhen suddenly the thunder-clap was heard,\\nIt took us unprepared and out of guard,\\nAlready lost before we fear\\'d.\\nThe amazing news of Charles at once were spread,\\nAt once the general voice declared,\\n\"Our gracious prince was dead.\"\\nNo sickness known before, no slow disease,\\nTo soften grief by just degrees:\\nBut like a hurricane on Indian seas,\\nThe tempest rose;\\nAn unexpected burst of woes;\\nWith scarce a breathing space betwixt--\\nThis now becalm\\'d, and perishing the next.\\nAs if great Atlas from his height\\nShould sink beneath his heavenly weight,\\nAnd with a mighty flaw, the flaming wall\\n(At once it shall),\\nShould gape immense, and rushing down, o\\'erwhelm this nether ball;\\nSo swift and so surprising was our fear:\\nOur Atlas fell indeed, but Hercules was near.\\nHis pious brother, sure the best\\nWho ever bore that name!\\nWas newly risen from his rest,\\nAnd, with a fervent flame,\\nHis usual morning vows had just address\\'d\\nFor his dear sovereign\\'s health;\\nAnd hoped to have them heard,\\nIn long increase of years,\\nIn honour, fame, and wealth:\\nGuiltless of greatness thus he always pray\\'d,\\nNor knew nor wish\\'d those vows he made,\\nOn his own head should be repaid.\\nSoon as the ill-omen\\'d rumour reach\\'d his ear,\\n(Ill news is wing\\'d with fate, and flies apace,)\\nWho can describe the amazement of his face!\\nHorror in all his pomp was there,\\nMute and magnificent without a tear:\\nAnd then the hero first was seen to fear.\\nHalf unarray\\'d he ran to his relief,\\nSo hasty and so artless was his grief:\\nApproaching greatness met him with her charms\\nOf power and future state;\\nBut look\\'d so ghastly in a brother\\'s fate,\\nHe shook her from his arms.\\nArrived within the mournful room, he saw\\nA wild distraction, void of awe,\\nAnd arbitrary grief unbounded by a law.\\nGod\\'s image, God\\'s anointed lay\\nWithout motion, pulse, or breath,\\nA senseless lump of sacred clay,\\nAn image now of death.\\nAmidst his sad attendants\\' groans and cries,', \"The lines of that adored, forgiving face,\\nDistorted from their native grace;\\nAn iron slumber sat on his majestic eyes.\\nThe pious duke--Forbear, audacious Muse!\\nNo terms thy feeble art can use\\nAre able to adorn so vast a woe:\\nThe grief of all the rest like subject-grief did show,\\nHis like a sovereign did transcend;\\nNo wife, no brother, such a grief could know,\\nNor any name but friend.\\nO wondrous changes of a fatal scene,\\nStill varying to the last!\\nHeaven, though its hard decree was past,\\nSeem'd pointing to a gracious turn again:\\nAnd death's uplifted arm arrested in its haste.\\nHeaven half repented of the doom,\\nAnd almost grieved it had foreseen,\\nWhat by foresight it will'd eternally to come.\\nMercy above did hourly plead\\nFor her resemblance here below;\\nAnd mild forgiveness intercede\\nTo stop the coming blow.\\nNew miracles approach'd the ethereal throne,\\nSuch as his wondrous life had oft and lately known,\\nAnd urged that still they might be shown.\\nOn earth his pious brother pray'd and vow'd,\\nRenouncing greatness at so dear a rate,\\nHimself defending what he could,\\nFrom all the glories of his future fate.\\nWith him the innumerable crowd\\nOf armed prayers\\nKnock'd at the gates of Heaven, and knock'd aloud;\\nThe first well-meaning rude petitioners,\\nAll for his life assail'd the throne,\\nAll would have bribed the skies by offering up their own.\\nSo great a throng not Heaven itself could bar;\\n'Twas almost borne by force as in the giants' war.\\nThe prayers, at least, for his reprieve were heard;\\nHis death, like Hezekiah's, was deferr'd:\\nAgainst the sun the shadow went;\\nFive days, those five degrees, were lent\\nTo form our patience and prepare the event.\\nThe second causes took the swift command,\\nThe medicinal head, the ready hand,\\nAll eager to perform their part;\\nAll but eternal doom was conquer'd by their art:\\nOnce more the fleeting soul came back\\nTo inspire the mortal frame;\\nAnd in the body took a doubtful stand,\\nDoubtful and hovering like expiring flame,\\nThat mounts and falls by turns, and trembles o'er the brand.\\nThe joyful short-lived news soon spread around,\\nTook the same train, the same impetuous bound:\\nThe drooping town in smiles again was dress'd,\\nGladness in every face express'd,\\nTheir eyes before their tongues confess'd.\\nMen met each other with erected look,\\nThe steps were higher that they took;\\nFriends to congratulate their friends made haste;\\nAnd long inveterate foes saluted as they pass'd:\\nAbove the rest heroic James appear'd--\\nExalted more, because he more had fear'd:\\nHis manly heart, whose noble pride\\nWas still above\\nDissembled hate or varnish'd love,\\nIts more than common transport could not hide;\\nBut like an eagre rode in triumph o'er the tide.\\nThus, in alternate course,\\nThe tyrant passions, hope and fear,\\nDid in extremes appear,\\nAnd flash'd upon the soul with equal force.\\nThus, at half ebb, a rolling sea\\nReturns and wins upon the shore;\\nThe watery herd, affrighted at the roar,\\nRest on their fins awhile, and stay,\\nThen backward take their wondering way:\\nThe prophet wonders more than they,\\nAt prodigies but rarely seen before,\\nAnd cries, A king must fall, or kingdoms change their sway.\\nSuch were our counter-tides at land, and so\\nPresaging of the fatal blow,\\nIn their prodigious ebb and flow.\\nThe royal soul, that, like the labouring moon,\\nBy charms of art was hurried down,\\nForced with regret to leave her native sphere,\\nCame but awhile on liking here:\\nSoon weary of the painful strife,\\nAnd made but faint essays of life:\\nAn evening light\\nSoon shut in night;\\nA strong distemper, and a weak relief,\\nShort intervals of joy, and long returns of grief.\\nThe sons of art all medicines tried,\\nAnd every noble remedy applied;\\nWith emulation each essay'd\\nHis utmost skill, nay more, they pray'd:\\nNever was losing game with better conduct play'd.\\nDeath never won a stake with greater toil,\\nNor e'er was fate so near a foil:\\nBut like a fortress on a rock,\\nThe impregnable disease their vain attempts did mock;\\nThey mined it near, they batter'd from afar\\nWith, all the cannon of the medicinal war;\\nNo gentle means could be essay'd,\\n'Twas beyond parley when the siege was laid:\\nThe extremest ways they first ordain,\\nPrescribing such intolerable pain,\\nAs none but CÃ¦sar could sustain:\\nUndaunted Csesar underwent\\nThe malice of their art, nor bent\\nBeneath whate'er their pious rigour could invent:\\nIn five such days he suffer'd more\\nThan any suffer'd in his reign before;\\nMore, infinitely more, than he,\\nAgainst the worst of rebels, could decree,\\nA traitor, or twice pardon'd enemy.\\nNow art was tried without success,\\nNo racks could make the stubborn malady confess.\\nThe vain insurancers of life,\\nAnd they who most perform'd and promised less,\\nEven Short and Hobbes forsook the unequal strife.\\nDeath and despair were in their looks,\\nNo longer they consult their memories or books;\\nLike helpless friends, who view from shore\\nThe labouring ship, and hear the tempest roar;\\nSo stood they with their arms across;\\nNot to assist, but to deplore\\nThe inevitable loss.\\nDeath was denounced; that frightful sound\\nWhich even the best can hardly bear,\\nHe took the summons void of fear;\\nAnd unconcern'dly cast his eyes around;\\nAs if to find and dare the grisly challenger.\\nWhat death could do he lately tried,\\nWhen in four days he more than died.\\nThe same assurance all his words did grace;\\nThe same majestic mildness held its place:\\nNor lost the monarch in his dying face.\\nIntrepid, pious, merciful, and brave,\\nHe look'd as when he conquer'd and forgave.\\nAs if some angel had been sent\\nTo lengthen out his government,\\nAnd to foretell as many years again,\\nAs he had number'd in his happy reign,\\nSo cheerfully he took the doom\\nOf his departing breath;\\nNor shrunk nor stepp'd aside for death;\\nBut with unalter'd pace kept on,\\nProviding for events to come,\\nWhen he resign'd the throne.\\nStill he maintain'd his kingly state;\\nAnd grew familiar with his fate.\\nKind, good, and gracious to the last,\\nOn all he loved before his dying beams he cast:\\nOh, truly good, and truly great,\\nFor glorious as he rose, benignly so he set!\\nAll that on earth he held most dear,\\nHe recommended to his care,\\nTo whom both Heaven,\\nThe right had given\\nAnd his own love bequeathed supreme command:\\nHe took and press'd that ever loyal hand\\nWhich could in peace secure his reign,\\nWhich could in wars his power maintain,\\nThat hand on which no plighted vows were ever vain.\\nWell for so great a trust he chose\\nA prince who never disobey'd:\\nNot when the most severe commands were laid;\\nNor want, nor exile with his duty weigh'd:\\nA prince on whom, if Heaven its eyes could close,\\nThe welfare of the world it safely might repose.\\nThat king who lived to God's own heart,\\nYet less serenely died than he:\\nCharles left behind no harsh decree\\nFor schoolmen with laborious art\\nTo salve from cruelty:\\nThose for whom love could no excuses frame,\\nHe graciously forgot to name.\\nThus far my Muse, though rudely, has design'd\\nSome faint resemblance of his godlike mind:\\nBut neither pen nor pencil can express\\nThe parting brothers' tenderness:\\nThough that's a term too mean and low;\\nThe blest above a kinder word may know.\\nBut what they did, and what they said,\\nThe monarch who triumphant went,\\nThe militant who staid,\\nLike painters, when their heightening arts are spent,\\nI cast into a shade.\\nThat all-forgiving king,\\nThe type of Him above,\\nThat inexhausted spring\\nOf clemency and love;\\nHimself to his next self accused,\\nAnd asked that pardon--which he ne'er refused:\\nFor faults not his, for guilt and crimes\\nOf godless men, and of rebellious times:\\nFor an hard exile, kindly meant,\\nWhen his ungrateful country sent\\nTheir best Camillus into banishment:\\nAnd forced their sovereign's act--they could not his consent.\\nOh, how much rather had that injured chief\\nRepeated all his sufferings past,\\nThan hear a pardon begg'd at last,\\nWhich, given, could give the dying no relief!\\nHe bent, he sunk beneath his grief:\\nHis dauntless heart would fain have held\\nFrom weeping, but his eyes rebell'd.\\nPerhaps the godlike hero in his breast\\nDisdain'd, or was ashamed to show,\\nSo weak, so womanish a woe,\\nWhich yet the brother and the friend so plenteously confess'd.\\nAmidst that silent shower, the royal mind\\nAn easy passage found,\\nAnd left its sacred earth behind:\\nNor murmuring groan express'd, nor labouring sound,\\nNor any least tumultuous breath;\\nCalm was his life, and quiet was his death.\\nSoft as those gentle whispers were,\\nIn which the Almighty did appear;\\nBy the still voice the prophet knew him there.\\nThat peace which made thy prosperous reign to shine,\\nThat peace thou leavest to thy imperial line,\\nThat peace, oh, happy shade, be ever thine!\\nFor all those joys thy restoration brought,\\nFor all the miracles it wrought,\\nFor all the healing balm thy mercy pour'd\\nInto the nation's bleeding wound,\\nAnd care that after kept it sound,\\nFor numerous blessings yearly shower'd,\\nAnd property with plenty crown'd;\\nFor freedom, still maintain'd alive--\\nFreedom! which in no other land will thrive--\\nFreedom! an English subject's sole prerogative,\\nWithout whose charms even peace would be\\nBut a dull, quiet slavery:\\nFor these and more, accept our pious praise;\\n'Tis all the subsidy\\nThe present age can raise,\\nThe rest is charged on late posterity:\\nPosterity is charged the more,\\nBecause the large abounding store\\nTo them and to their heirs, is still entail'd by thee.\\nSuccession of a long descent\\nWhich chastely in the channels ran,\\nAnd from our demi-gods began,\\nEqual almost to time in its extent,\\nThrough hazards numberless and great,\\nThou hast derived this mighty blessing down,\\nAnd fix'd the fairest gem that decks the imperial crown\\nNot faction, when it shook thy regal seat,\\nNot senates, insolently loud,\\nThose echoes of a thoughtless crowd,\\nNot foreign or domestic treachery,\\nGould warp thy soul to their unjust decree.\\nSo much thy foes thy manly mind mistook,\\nWho judged it by the mildness of thy look:\\nLike a well-temper'd sword it bent at will;\\nBut kept the native toughness of the steel.\\nBe true, O Clio, to thy hero's name!\\nBut draw him strictly so,\\nThat all who view the piece may know.\\nHe needs no trappings of fictitious fame:\\nThe load's too weighty: thou mayest choose\\nSome parts of praise, and some refuse:\\nWrite, that his annals may be thought more lavish than the Muse.\\nIn scanty truth thou hast confined\\nThe virtues of a royal mind,\\nForgiving, bounteous, humble, just, and kind:\\nHis conversation, wit, and parts,\\nHis knowledge in the noblest useful arts,\\nWere such, dead authors could not give;\\nBut habitudes of those who live;\\nWho, lighting him, did greater lights receive:\\nHe drain'd from all, and all they knew;\\nHis apprehension quick, his judgment true:\\nThat the most learn'd, with shame, confess\\nHis knowledge more, his reading only less.\\nAmidst the peaceful triumphs of his reign,\\nWhat wonder if the kindly beams he shed\\nRevived the drooping Arts again;\\nIf Science raised her head,\\nAnd soft Humanity, that from rebellion fled!\\nOur isle, indeed, too fruitful was before;\\nBut all uncultivated lay\\nOut of the solar walk and Heaven's highway;\\nWith rank Geneva weeds run o'er,\\nAnd cockle, at the best, amidst the corn it bore.\\nThe royal husbandman appear'd,\\nAnd plough'd, and sow'd, and till'd;\\nThe thorns he rooted out, the rubbish clear'd,\\nAnd bless'd the obedient field:\\nWhen straight a double harvest rose;\\nSuch as the swarthy Indian mows;\\nOr happier climates near the line,\\nOr Paradise manured and dress'd by hands divine.\\nAs when the new-born Phoenix takes his way,\\nHis rich paternal regions to survey,\\nOf airy choristers a numerous train\\nAttends his wondrous progress o'er the plain;\\nSo, rising from his father's urn,\\nSo glorious did our Charles return;\\nThe officious Muses came along--\\nA gay harmonious quire, like angels ever young:\\nThe Muse that mourns him now, his happy triumph sung,\\nEven they could thrive in his auspicious reign;\\nAnd such a plenteous crop they bore\\nOf purest and well-winnow'd grain,\\nAs Britain never knew before.\\nThough little was their hire, and light their gain,\\nYet somewhat to their share he threw;\\nFed from his hand, they sung and flew,\\nLike birds of Paradise that lived on morning dew.\\nOh, never let their lays his name forget!\\nThe pension of a prince's praise is great.\\nLive, then, thou great encourager of arts!\\nLive ever in our thankful hearts;\\nLive blest above, almost invoked below;\\nLive and receive this pious vow,\\nOur patron once, our guardian angel now!\\nThou Fabius of a sinking state,\\nWho didst by wise delays divert our fate,\\nWhen faction like a tempest rose,\\nIn death's most hideous form,\\nThen art to rage thou didst oppose,\\nTo weather-out the storm:\\nNot quitting thy supreme command,\\nThou held'st the rudder with a steady hand,\\nTill safely on the shore the bark did land:\\nThe bark that all our blessings brought,\\nCharged with thyself and James, a doubly royal fraught.\\nOh, frail estate of human things,\\nAnd slippery hopes below!\\nNow to our cost your emptiness we know,\\nFor 'tis a lesson dearly bought,\\nAssurance here is never to be sought.\\nThe best, and best beloved of kings,\\nAnd best deserving to be so,\\nWhen scarce he had escaped the fatal blow\\nOf faction and conspiracy,\\nDeath did his promised hopes destroy:\\nHe toil'd, he gain'd, but lived not to enjoy.\\nWhat mists of Providence are these,\\nThrough which we cannot see!\\nSo saints, by supernatural power set free,\\nAre left at last in martyrdom to die;\\nSuch is the end of oft-repeated miracles.\\nForgive me, Heaven, that impious thought!\\n'Twas grief for Charles, to madness wrought,\\nThat question'd thy supreme decree.\\nThou didst his gracious reign prolong,\\nEven in thy saints' and angels' wrong,\\nHis fellow-citizens of immortality:\\nFor twelve long years of exile borne,\\nTwice twelve we number'd since his blest return:\\nSo strictly wert thou just to pay,\\nEven to the driblet of a day.\\nYet still we murmur and complain,\\nThe quails and manna should no longer rain;\\nThose miracles 'twas needless to renew;\\nThe chosen stock has now the promised land in view.\\nA warlike prince ascends the regal state,\\nA prince long exercised by fate:\\nLong may he keep, though he obtains it late!\\nHeroes in Heaven's peculiar mould are cast,\\nThey and their poets are not form'd in haste;\\nMan was the first in God's design, and man was made the last.\\nFalse heroes, made by flattery so,\\nHeaven can strike out, like sparkles, at a blow;\\nBut ere a prince is to perfection brought,\\nHe costs Omnipotence a second thought.\\nWith toil and sweat,\\nWith hardening cold, and forming heat,\\nThe Cyclops did their strokes repeat,\\nBefore the impenetrable shield was wrought.\\nIt looks as if the Maker would not own\\nThe noble work for His,\\nBefore 'twas tried and found a masterpiece.\\nView, then, a monarch ripen'd for a throne!\\nAlcides thus his race began,\\nO'er infancy he swiftly ran;\\nThe future god at first was more than man:\\nDangers and toils, and Juno's hate,\\nEven o'er his cradle lay in wait;\\nAnd there he grappled first with fate:\\nIn his young hands the hissing snakes he press'd,\\nSo early was the deity confess'd.\\nThus by degrees he rose to Jove's imperial seat;\\nThus difficulties prove a soul legitimately great.\\nLike his, our hero's infancy was tried;\\nBetimes the Furies did their snakes provide;\\nAnd to his infant arms oppose\\nHis father's rebels, and his brother's foes;\\nThe more oppress'd, the higher still he rose:\\nThose were the preludes of his fate,\\nThat form'd his manhood, to subdue\\nThe Hydra of the many-headed hissing crew.\\nAs after Numa's peaceful reign,\\nThe martial Ancus did the sceptre wield,\\nFurbish'd the rusty sword again,\\nResumed the long-forgotten shield,\\nAnd led the Latins to the dusty field;\\nSo James the drowsy genius wakes\\nOf Britain, long entranced in charms,\\nRestive and slumbering on its arms:\\n'Tis roused, and with a new-strung nerve, the spear already shakes,\\nNo neighing of the warrior steeds,\\nNo drum, or louder trumpet, needs\\nTo inspire the coward, warm the cold--\\nHis voice, his sole appearance makes them bold.\\nGaul and Batavia dread the impending blow;\\nToo well the vigour of that arm they know;\\nThey lick the dust, and crouch beneath their fatal foe.\\nLong may they fear this awful prince,\\nAnd not provoke his lingering sword;\\nPeace is their only sure defence,\\nTheir best security his word:\\nIn all the changes of his doubtful state,\\nHis truth, like Heaven's, was kept inviolate,\\nFor him to promise is to make it fate.\\nHis valour can triumph o'er land and main;\\nWith broken oaths his fame he will not stain;\\nWith conquest basely bought, and with inglorious gain.\\nFor once, O Heaven! unfold thy adamantine book;\\nAnd let his wondering senate see,\\nIf not thy firm immutable decree,\\nAt least the second page of strong contingency;\\nSuch as consists with wills originally free:\\nLet them with glad amazement look\\nOn what their happiness may be:\\nLet them not still be obstinately blind,\\nStill to divert the good thou hast design'd,\\nOr with malignant penury,\\nTo starve the royal virtues of his mind.\\nFaith is a Christian's and a subject's test,\\nO give them to believe, and they are surely blest!\\nThey do; and with a distant view I see\\nThe amended vows of English loyalty.\\nAnd all beyond that object,

unspotted, innocent within,\\nShe fear'd no danger, for she knew no sin.\\nYet had she oft been chased with horns and hounds,\\nAnd Scythian shafts; and many winged wounds\\nAim'd at her heart; was often forced to fly,\\nAnd doom'd to death, though fated not to die.\\nNot so her young; for their unequal line\\nWas hero's make, half human, half divine.                           \\nTheir earthly

arose,\\nAnd cried for pardon on their perjured foes.\\nTheir fate was fruitful, and the sanguine seed,\\nEndued with souls, increased the sacred breed.\\nSo captive Israel multiplied in chains,\\nA numerous exile, and enjoy'd her pains.                            \\nWith grief and gladness mix'd, the mother view'd\\nHer martyr'd offspring, and their race renew'd;\\nTheir corpse to perish, but

contain.\\nAnd some wild curs, who from their masters ran,\\nAbhorring the supremacy of man,\\nIn woods and caves the rebel race began.\\nO happy pair, how well have you increased!\\nWhat ills in Church and State have you redress'd!\\nWith teeth untried, and rudiments of claws,\\nYour first essay was on your native laws:                          \\nThose having torn with ease, and trampled down,\\nYour fangs you fasten'd on the mitred crown,\\nAnd freed from God and monarchy your town.\\nWhat though your native kennel still be small,\\nBounded betwixt a puddle and a wall;\\nYet your victorious colonies are sent\\nWhere the north ocean girds the continent.\\nQuicken'd with fire below, your monsters breed\\nIn fenny Holland, and in fruitful Tweed:\\nAnd, like the first, the last affects to be                        \\nDrawn to the dregs of a democracy.\\nAs, where in fields the fairy rounds are seen,\\nA rank, sour herbage rises on the green;\\nSo, springing where those midnight elves advance,\\nRebellion prints the footsteps of the dance.\\nSuch are their doctrines, such contempt they show\\nTo Heaven above and to their prince below,\\nAs none but traitors and blasphemers know.\\nGod, like the tyrant of the skies, is placed,\\nAnd kings, like slaves, beneath the crowd debased.                 \\nSo fulsome is their food, that flocks refuse\\nTo bite, and only dogs for physic use.\\nAs, where the lightning runs along the ground,\\nNo husbandry can heal the blasting wound;\\nNor bladed grass, nor bearded corn succeeds,\\nBut scales of scurf and putrefaction breeds:\\nSuch wars, such waste, such fiery tracks of dearth\\nTheir zeal has left, and such a teemless earth,\\nBut, as the poisons of the deadliest kind\\nAre to their own unhappy coasts confined;                          \\nAs only Indian shades of sight deprive,\\nAnd magic plants will but in Colchos thrive;\\nSo Presbytery and pestilential zeal\\nCan only nourish in a commonweal.\\nFrom Celtic woods is chased the wolfish crew;\\nBut ah! some pity even to brutes is due:\\nTheir native walks methinks they might enjoy,\\nCurb'd of their native malice to destroy.\\nOf all the tyrannies on human kind,\\nThe worst is that which persecutes the mind.                       \\nLet us but weigh at what offence we strike;\\n'Tis but because we cannot think alike.\\nIn punishing of this, we overthrow\\nThe laws of nations and of nature too.\\nBeasts are the subjects of tyrannic sway,\\nWhere still the stronger on the weaker prey.\\nMan only of a softer mould is made,\\nNot for his fellows' ruin, but their aid:\\nCreated kind, beneficent, and free,\\nThe noble image of the Deity.                                      \\nOne portion of informing fire was given\\nTo brutes, the inferior family of heaven:\\nThe Smith Divine, as with a careless beat,                         \\nStruck out the mute creation at a heat:\\nBut when arrived at last to human race,\\nThe Godhead took a deep-considering space;\\nAnd to distinguish man from all the rest,\\nUnlock'd the sacred treasures of his breast;\\nAnd mercy mix'd with reason did impart,\\nOne to his head, the other to his heart:                           \\nReason to rule, and mercy to forgive;\\nThe first is law, the last prerogative.\\nAnd like his mind his outward form appear'd,\\nWhen, issuing naked, to the wondering herd,\\nHe charm'd their eyes; and, for they loved, they fear'd:\\nNot arm'd with horns of arbitrary might,\\nOr claws to seize their furry spoils in fight,\\nOr with increase of feet to o'ertake them in their flight:\\nOf easy shape, and pliant every way;\\nConfessing still the softness of his clay,                         \\nAnd kind as kings upon their coronation day:\\nWith open hands, and with extended space\\nOf arms, to satisfy a large embrace.\\nThus kneaded up with milk, the new-made man\\nHis kingdom o'er his kindred world began:\\nTill knowledge misapplied, misunderstood,\\nAnd pride of empire, sour'd his balmy blood.\\nThen, first rebelling, his own stamp he coins;\\nThe murderer Cain was latent in his loins:\\nAnd blood began its first and loudest cry,                         \\nFor differing worship of the Deity.\\nThus persecution rose, and further space\\nProduced the mighty hunter of his race.\\nNot so the blessed Pan his flock increased,\\nContent to fold them from the famish'd beast:\\nMild were his laws; the Sheep and harmless Hind                    \\nWere never of the persecuting kind.\\nSuch pity now the pious pastor shows,\\nSuch mercy from the British Lion flows,\\nThat both provide protection from their foes.\\nO happy regions, Italy and Spain,\\nWhich never did those monsters entertain!\\nThe Wolf, the Bear, the Boar, can there advance\\nNo native claim of just inheritance.\\nAnd self-preserving laws, severe in show,\\nMay guard their fences from the invading foe.\\nWhere birth has placed them, let them safely share\\nThe common benefit of vital air.\\nThemselves unharmful, let them live unharm'd;\\nTheir jaws disabled, and their claws disarm'd:                     \\nHere, only in nocturnal howlings bold,\\nThey dare not seize the hind, nor leap the fold.\\nMore powerful, and as vigilant as they,\\nThe Lion awfully forbids the prey.\\nTheir rage repress'd, though pinch'd with famine sore,\\nThey stand aloof, and tremble at his roar:\\nMuch is their hunger, but their fear is more.\\nThese are the chief: to number o'er the rest,\\nAnd stand, like Adam, naming every beast,\\nWere weary work; nor will the muse describe                        \\nA slimy-born and sun-begotten tribe;\\nWho far from steeples and their sacred sound,\\nIn fields their sullen conventicles found.\\nThese gross, half-animated lumps I leave;\\nNor can I think what thoughts they can conceive.\\nBut if they think at all, 'tis sure no higher\\nThan matter, put in motion, may aspire:\\nSouls that can scarce ferment their mass of clay;\\nSo drossy, so divisible are they,\\nAs would but serve pure bodies for allay:                          \\nSuch souls as shards produce, such beetle things\\nAs only buzz to heaven with evening wings;\\nStrike in the dark, offending but by chance,\\nSuch are the blindfold blows of ignorance.\\nThey know not beings, and but hate a name;\\nTo them the Hind and Panther are the same.\\nThe Panther sure the noblest, next the Hind,\\nAnd fairest creature of the spotted kind;\\nOh, could her inborn stains be wash'd away,\\nShe were too good to be a beast of prey!                           \\nHow can I praise, or blame, and not offend,\\nOr how divide the frailty from the friend?\\nHer faults and virtues lie so mix'd, that she\\nNor wholly stands condemn'd, nor wholly free.\\nThen, like her injured Lion, let me speak;\\nHe cannot bend her, and he would not break.\\nUnkind already, and estranged in part,\\nThe Wolf begins to share her wandering heart.\\nThough unpolluted yet with actual ill,\\nShe half commits, who sins but in her will.                        \\nIf, as our dreaming Platonists report,\\nThere could be spirits of a middle sort,\\nToo black for heaven, and yet too white for hell,\\nWho just dropt half way down, nor lower fell;\\nSo poised, so gently she descends from high,\\nIt seems a soft dismission from the sky.\\nHer house not ancient, whatsoe'er pretence\\nHer clergy heralds make in her defence.\\nA second century not half-way run,\\nSince the new honours of her blood begun.                          \\nA Lion old, obscene, and furious made\\nBy lust, compress'd her mother in a shade;\\nThen, by a left-hand marriage, weds the dame,\\nCovering adultery with a specious name:\\nSo Schism begot; and Sacrilege and she,\\nA well match'd pair, got graceless Heresy.\\nGod's and king's rebels have the same good cause,\\nTo trample down divine and human laws:\\nBoth would be call'd reformers, and their hate\\nAlike destructive both to Church and State:                        \\nThe fruit proclaims the plant; a lawless prince\\nBy luxury reform'd incontinence;\\nBy ruins, charity; by riots, abstinence.\\nConfessions, fasts, and penance set aside,\\nOh, with what ease we follow such a guide,\\nWhere souls are starved, and senses gratified!\\nWhere marriage pleasures midnight prayers supply,\\nAnd matin bells, a melancholy cry,\\nAre tuned to merrier notes, Increase and multiply.\\nReligion shows a rosy-colour'd face;                               \\nNot batter'd out with drudging works of grace:\\nA down-hill reformation rolls apace.\\nWhat flesh and blood would crowd the narrow gate,\\nOr, till they waste their pamper'd paunches, wait?\\nAll would be happy at the cheapest rate.\\nThough our lean faith these rigid laws has given,\\nThe full-fed Mussulman goes fat to heaven;\\nFor his Arabian prophet with delights\\nOf sense allured his eastern proselytes.\\nThe jolly Luther, reading him, began                               \\nTo interpret Scriptures by his Alcoran;\\nTo grub the thorns beneath our tender feet,\\nAnd make the paths of Paradise more sweet;\\nBethought him of a wife ere half way gone,\\nFor 'twas uneasy travelling alone;\\nAnd, in this masquerade of mirth and love,\\nMistook the bliss of heaven for Bacchanals above.\\nSure he presumed of praise, who came to stock\\nThe ethereal pastures with so fair a flock,\\nBurnish'd, and battening on their food, to show                    \\nTheir diligence of careful herds below.\\nOur Panther, though like these she changed her head,\\nYet, as the mistress of a monarch's bed,\\nHer front erect with majesty she bore,\\nThe crosier wielded, and the mitre wore.\\nHer upper part of decent discipline\\nShow'd affectation of an ancient line;\\nAnd Fathers, Councils, Church, and Church's head,\\nWere on her reverend phylacteries read.\\nBut what disgraced and disavow'd the rest,                         \\nWas Calvin's brand, that stigmatized the beast.\\nThus, like a creature of a double kind,\\nIn her own labyrinth she lives confined.\\nTo foreign lands no sound of her is come,\\nHumbly content to be despised at home.\\nSuch is her faith, where good cannot be had,\\nAt least she leaves the refuse of the bad:\\nNice in her choice of ill, though not of best,\\nAnd least deform'd, because reform'd the least.\\nIn doubtful points betwixt her differing friends,                  \\nWhere one for substance, one for sign contends,\\nTheir contradicting terms she strives to join;\\nSign shall be substance, substance shall be sign.\\nA real presence all her sons allow,\\nAnd yet 'tis flat idolatry to bow,\\nBecause the Godhead's there they know not how.\\nHer novices are taught that bread and wine\\nAre but the visible and outward sign,\\nReceived by those who in communion join.\", 'But the inward grace, or the thing signified,                      \\nHis blood and body, who to save us died;\\nThe faithful this thing signified receive:\\nWhat is\\'t those faithful then partake or leave?\\nFor what is signified and understood,\\nIs, by her own confession, flesh and blood.\\nThen, by the same acknowledgment, we know\\nThey take the sign, and take the substance too.\\nThe literal sense is hard to flesh and blood,\\nBut nonsense never can be understood.\\nHer wild belief on every wave is toss\\'d;                         \\nBut sure no Church can better morals boast:\\nTrue to her king her principles are found;\\nO that her practice were but half so sound!\\nSteadfast in various turns of state she stood,\\nAnd seal\\'d her vow\\'d affection with her blood:\\nNor will I meanly tax her constancy,\\nThat interest or obligement made the tie\\nBound to the fate of murder\\'d monarchy.\\nBefore the sounding axe so falls the vine,\\nWhose tender branches round the poplar twine.                      \\nShe chose her ruin, and resign\\'d her life,\\nIn death undaunted as an Indian wife:\\nA rare example! but some souls we see\\nGrow hard, and stiffen with adversity:\\nYet these by fortune\\'s favours are undone;\\nResolved into a baser form they run,\\nAnd bore the wind, but cannot bear the sun.\\nLet this be nature\\'s frailty, or her fate,\\nOr Isgrim\\'s counsel, her new-chosen mate;\\nStill she\\'s the fairest of the fallen crew,                        \\nNo mother more indulgent, but the true.\\nFierce to her foes, yet fears her force to try,\\nBecause she wants innate authority;\\nFor how can she constrain them to obey,\\nWho has herself cast off the lawful sway?\\nRebellion equals all, and those who toil\\nIn common theft, will share the common spoil.\\nLet her produce the title and the right\\nAgainst her old superiors first to fight;\\nIf she reform by text, even that\\'s as plain                        \\nFor her own rebels to reform again.\\nAs long as words a different sense will bear,\\nAnd each may be his own interpreter,\\nOur airy faith will no foundation find:\\nThe word\\'s a weathercock for every wind:\\nThe Bear, the Fox, the Wolf, by turns prevail;\\nThe most in power supplies the present gale.\\nThe wretched Panther cries aloud for aid\\nTo Church and Councils, whom she first betray\\'d;\\nNo help from Fathers or Tradition\\'s train:                         \\nThose ancient guides she taught us to disdain,\\nAnd, by that Scripture, which she once abused\\nTo reformation, stands herself accused.\\nWhat bills for breach of laws can she prefer,\\nExpounding which she owns herself may err?\\nAnd, after all her winding ways are tried,\\nIf doubts arise, she slips herself aside,\\nAnd leaves the private conscience for the guide.\\nIf then that conscience set the offender free,\\nIt bars her claim to Church authority.                             \\nHow can she censure, or what crime pretend,\\nBut Scripture may be construed to defend?\\nEven those, whom for rebellion she transmits \\nTo civil power, her doctrine first acquits;\\nBecause no disobedience can ensue,\\nWhere no submission to a judge is due;\\nEach judging for himself, by her consent,\\nWhom thus absolved she sends to punishment.\\nSuppose the magistrate revenge her cause,\\n\\'Tis only for transgressing human laws. \\nHow answering to its end a Church is made,\\nWhose power is but to counsel and persuade?\\nOh, solid rock, on which secure she stands!\\nEternal house, not built with mortal hands!\\nOh, sure defence against the infernal gate,--\\nA patent during pleasure of the state!\\nThus is the Panther neither loved nor fear\\'d,\\nA mere mock queen of a divided herd;\\nWhom soon by lawful power she might control,\\nHerself a part submitted to the whole. \\nThen, as the moon who first receives the light\\nBy which she makes our nether regions bright,\\nSo might she shine, reflecting from afar\\nThe rays she borrow\\'d from a better star;\\nBig with the beams which from her mother flow,\\nAnd reigning o\\'er the rising tides below:\\nNow, mixing with a savage crowd, she goes,\\nAnd meanly flatters her inveterate foes;\\nRuled while she rules, and losing every hour\\nHer wretched remnants of precarious power. \\nOne evening, while the cooler shade she sought,\\nRevolving many a melancholy thought,\\nAlone she walk\\'d, and look\\'d around in vain,\\nWith rueful visage, for her vanish\\'d train:\\nNone of her sylvan subjects made their court;\\nLevÃ©es and couchÃ©es pass\\'d without resort.\\nSo hardly can usurpers manage well                                 \\nThose whom they first instructed to rebel.\\nMore liberty begets desire of more;\\nThe hunger still increases with the store.\\nWithout respect they brush\\'d along the wood,\\nEach in his clan, and, fill\\'d with loathsome food,\\nAsk\\'d no permission to the neighbouring flood.\\nThe Panther, full of inward discontent,\\nSince they would go, before them wisely went;\\nSupplying want of power by drinking first,\\nAs if she gave them leave to quench their thirst.\\nAmong the rest, the Hind, with fearful face,\\nBeheld from far the common watering place,\\nNor durst approach; till, with an awful roar,                      \\nThe sovereign Lion bade her fear no more.\\nEncouraged thus she brought her younglings nigh,\\nWatching the motions of her patron\\'s eye,\\nAnd drank a sober draught; the rest amazed\\nStood mutely still, and on the stranger gazed;\\nSurvey\\'d her part by part, and sought to find\\nThe ten-horn\\'d monster in the harmless Hind,\\nSuch as the Wolf and Panther had design\\'d.\\nThey thought at first they dream\\'d; for \\'twas offence\\nWith them to question certitude of sense,                          \\nTheir guide in faith: but nearer when they drew,\\nAnd had the faultless object full in view,\\nLord, how they all admired her heavenly hue!\\nSome, who before her fellowship disdain\\'d,\\nScarce, and but scarce, from in-born rage restrain\\'d,\\nNow frisk\\'d about her, and old kindred feign\\'d.\\nWhether for love or interest, every sect\\nOf all the savage nation show\\'d respect.\\nThe viceroy Panther could not awe the herd;                        \\nThe more the company, the less they fear\\'d.\\nThe surly Wolf with secret envy burst,\\nYet could not howl; (the Hind had seen him first:)\\nBut what he durst not speak the Panther durst.\\nFor when the herd, sufficed, did late repair,\\nTo ferny heaths, and to their forest lair,\\nShe made a mannerly excuse to stay,\\nProffering the Hind to wait her half the way:\\nThat, since the sky was clear, an hour of talk\\nMight help her to beguile the tedious walk.\\nWith much good-will the motion was embraced,                       \\nTo chat a while on their adventures pass\\'d:\\nNor had the grateful Hind so soon forgot\\nHer friend and fellow-sufferer in the Plot.\\nYet, wondering how of late she grew estranged,\\nHer forehead cloudy, and her countenance changed,\\nShe thought this hour the occasion would present\\nTo learn her secret cause of discontent,\\nWhich well she hoped might be with ease redress\\'d,\\nConsidering her a well-bred civil beast,\\nAnd more a gentlewoman than the rest.                              \\nAfter some common talk what rumours ran,\\nThe lady of the spotted muff began.\\n\\nDame, said the Panther, times are mended well,\\nSince late among the Philistines you fell.\\nThe toils were pitch\\'d, a spacious tract of ground\\nWith expert huntsmen was encompass\\'d round;\\nThe enclosure narrow\\'d; the sagacious power                          \\nOf hounds and death drew nearer every hour.\\n\\'Tis true, the younger Lion \\'scaped the snare,\\nBut all your priestly Calves lay struggling there,\\nAs sacrifices on their altar laid;\\nWhile you, their careful mother, wisely fled,                       \\nNot trusting destiny to save your head;\\nFor, whate\\'er promises you have applied\\nTo your unfailing Church, the surer side\\nIs four fair legs in danger to provide.\\nAnd whate\\'er tales of Peter\\'s chair you tell,\\nYet, saving reverence of the miracle,\\nThe better luck was yours to \\'scape so well.\\nAs I remember, said the sober Hind,\\nThose toils were for your own dear self design\\'d,\\nAs well as me, and with the self-same throw,                        \\nTo catch the quarry and the vermin too.\\n(Forgive the slanderous tongues that call\\'d you so.)\\nHowe\\'er you take it now, the common cry\\nThen ran you down for your rank loyalty.\\nBesides, in Popery they thought you nursed,\\nAs evil tongues will ever speak the worst,\\nBecause some forms, and ceremonies some\\nYou kept, and stood in the main question dumb.\\nDumb you were born indeed; but thinking long\\nThe Test it seems at last has loosed your tongue.              \\nAnd to explain what your forefathers meant,\\nBy real presence in the sacrament,\\nAfter long fencing push\\'d against the wall.\\nYour salvo comes, that he\\'s not there at all:\\nThere changed your faith, and what may change may fall.\\nWho can believe what varies every day,\\nNor ever was, nor will be at a stay?\\nTortures may force the tongue untruths to tell,\\nAnd I ne\\'er own\\'d myself infallible,\\nReplied the Panther: grant such presence were,                      \\nYet in your sense I never own\\'d it there.\\nA real virtue we by faith receive,\\nAnd that we in the sacrament believe.\\nThen, said the Hind, as you the matter state,\\nNot only Jesuits can equivocate;\\nFor real, as you now the word expound,\\nFrom solid substance dwindles to a sound.\\nMethinks an Ã†sop\\'s fable you repeat;\\nYou know who took the shadow for the meat:\\nYour Church\\'s substance thus you change at will,                    \\nAnd yet retain your former figure still.\\nI freely grant you spoke to save your life;\\nFor then you lay beneath the butcher\\'s knife.\\nLong time you fought, redoubled battery bore,\\nBut, after all, against yourself you swore;\\nYour former self: for every hour your form\\nIs chopp\\'d and changed, like winds before a storm.\\nThus fear and interest will prevail with some;\\nFor all have not the gift of martyrdom.\\nThe Panther grinn\\'d at this, and thus replied:                    \\nThat men may err was never yet denied.\\nBut, if that common principle be true,\\nThe canon, dame, is levell\\'d full at you.\\nBut, shunning long disputes, I fain would see\\nThat wondrous wight Infallibility.\\nIs he from Heaven, this mighty champion, come;\\nOr lodged below in subterranean Rome?\\nFirst, seat him somewhere, and derive his race,\\nOr else conclude that nothing has no place.\\nSuppose (though I disown it), said the Hind,                        \\nThe certain mansion were not yet assign\\'d;\\nThe doubtful residence no proof can bring\\nAgainst the plain existence of the thing.\\nBecause philosophers may disagree\\nIf sight by emission or reception be,\\nShall it be thence inferr\\'d, I do not see?\\nBut you require an answer positive,\\nWhich yet, when I demand, you dare not give;\\nFor fallacies in universals live.\\nI then affirm that this unfailing guide                             \\nIn Pope and General Councils must reside;\\nBoth lawful, both combined: what one decrees\\nBy numerous votes, the other ratifies:\\nOn this undoubted sense the Church relies.\\n\\'Tis true, some doctors in a scantier space,\\nI mean, in each apart, contract the place.\\nSome, who to greater length extend the line,\\nThe Church\\'s after-acceptation join.\\nThis last circumference appears too wide;\\nThe Church diffused is by the Council tied;                         \\nAs members by their representatives\\nObliged to laws which Prince and Senate gives.\\nThus some contract, and some enlarge the space:\\nIn Pope and Council, who denies the place,\\nAssisted from above with God\\'s unfailing grace?\\nThose canons all the needful points contain;\\nTheir sense so obvious, and their words so plain,\\nThat no disputes about the doubtful text\\nHave hitherto the labouring world perplex\\'d.\\nIf any should in after-times appear,                               \\nNew Councils must be call\\'d, to make the meaning clear:\\nBecause in them the power supreme resides;\\nAnd all the promises are to the guides.\\nThis may be taught with sound and safe defence;\\nBut mark how sandy is your own pretence,\\nWho, setting Councils, Pope, and Church aside,\\nAre every man his own presuming guide.\\nThe Sacred Books, you say, are full and plain.\\nAnd every needful point of truth contain:\\nAll who can read interpreters may be:                              \\nThus, though your several Churches disagree,\\nYet every saint has to himself alone\\nThe secret of this philosophic stone.\\nThese principles your jarring sects unite,\\nWhen differing doctors and disciples fight.\\nThough Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, holy chiefs,\\nHave made a battle royal of beliefs;\\nOr, like wild horses, several ways have whirl\\'d\\nThe tortured text about the Christian world;\\nEach Jehu lashing on with furious force,                           \\nThat Turk or Jew could not have used it worse;\\nNo matter what dissension leaders make,\\nWhere every private man may save a stake:\\nRuled by the Scripture and his own advice,\\nEach has a blind by-path to Paradise;\\nWhere, driving in a circle, slow or fast,\\nOpposing sects are sure to meet at last.\\nA wondrous charity you have in store\\nFor all reform\\'d to pass the narrow door:\\nSo much, that Mahomet had scarcely more.                           \\nFor he, kind prophet, was for damning none;\\nBut Christ and Moses were to save their own:\\nHimself was to secure his chosen race,\\nThough reason good for Turks to take the place,\\nAnd he allow\\'d to be the better man,\\nIn virtue of his holier Alcoran.\\nTrue, said the Panther, I shall ne\\'er deny\\nMy brethren may be saved as well as I:\\nThough Huguenots condemn our ordination,\\nSuccession, ministerial vocation;                                  \\nAnd Luther, more mistaking what he read,\\nMisjoins the sacred body with the bread:\\nYet, lady, still remember, I maintain,\\nThe Word in needful points is only plain.\\nNeedless, or needful, I not now contend,\\nFor still you have a loop-hole for a friend;\\nRejoin\\'d the matron: but the rule you lay\\nHas led whole flocks, and leads them still astray,\\nIn weighty points, and full damnation\\'s way.\\nFor did not Arius first, Socinus now,                              \\nThe Son\\'s Eternal Godhead disavow?\\nAnd did not these by gospel texts alone\\nCondemn our doctrine, and maintain their own?\\nHave not all heretics the same pretence\\nTo plead the Scriptures in their own defence?\\nHow did the Nicene Council then decide\\nThat strong debate? was it by Scripture tried?\\nNo, sure; to that the rebel would not yield;\\nSquadrons of texts he marshall\\'d in the field:\\nThat was but civil war, an equal set,                              \\nWhere piles with piles, and eagles eagles met.\\nWith texts point-blank and plain he faced the foe.\\nAnd did not Satan tempt our Saviour so?\\nThe good old bishops took a simpler way;\\nEach ask\\'d but what he heard his father say,\\nOr how he was instructed in his youth,\\nAnd by tradition\\'s force upheld the truth.\\nThe Panther smiled at this; and when, said she,\\nWere those first Councils disallow\\'d by me?\\nOr where did I at sure Tradition strike,                           \\nProvided still it were apostolic?\\nFriend, said the Hind, you quit your former ground,\\nWhere all your faith you did on Scripture found:\\nNow \\'tis Tradition join\\'d with Holy Writ;\\nBut thus your memory betrays your wit.\\nNo, said the Panther, for in that I view,\\nWhen your tradition\\'s forged, and when \\'tis true.\\nI set them by the rule, and, as they square,\\nOr deviate from, undoubted doctrine there,\\nThis oral fiction, that old faith declare.                         \\nHind: The Council steer\\'d, it seems, a different course;\\nThey tried the Scripture by Tradition\\'s force:\\nBut you Tradition by the Scripture try;\\nPursued by sects, from this to that you fly,\\nNor dare on one foundation to rely.\\nThe Word is then deposed, and in this view,\\nYou rule the Scripture, not the Scripture you.\\nThus said the dame, and, smiling, thus pursued:\\nI see Tradition then is disallow\\'d,\\nWhen not evinced by Scripture to be true,                          \\nAnd Scripture, as interpreted by you.\\nBut here you tread upon unfaithful ground;\\nUnless you could infallibly expound:\\nWhich you reject as odious Popery,\\nAnd throw that doctrine back with scorn on me.\\nSuppose we on things traditive divide,\\nAnd both appeal to Scripture to decide;\\nBy various texts we both uphold our claim,\\nNay, often ground our titles on the same:\\nAfter long labour lost, and time\\'s expense,                        \\nBoth grant the words, and quarrel for the sense.\\nThus all disputes for ever must depend;\\nFor no dumb rule can controversies end.\\nThus, when you said, Tradition must be tried\\nBy Sacred Writ, whose sense yourselves decide,\\nYou said no more, but that yourselves must be\\nThe judges of the Scripture sense, not we.\\nAgainst our Church-Tradition you declare,\\nAnd yet your clerks would sit in Moses\\' chair;\\nAt least \\'tis proved against your argument,                        \\nThe rule is far from plain, where all dissent.\\nIf not by Scriptures, how can we be sure,\\nReplied the Panther, what Tradition\\'s pure?\\nFor you may palm upon us new for old:\\nAll, as they say, that glitters, is not gold.\\nHow but by following her, replied the dame,\\nTo whom derived from sire to son they came;\\nWhere every age does on another move,\\nAnd trusts no farther than the next above;\\nWhere all the rounds like Jacob\\'s ladder rise,                     \\nThe lowest hid in earth, the topmost in the skies.\\nSternly the savage did her answer mark,\\nHer glowing eye-balls glittering in the dark,\\nAnd said but this: Since lucre was your trade,\\nSucceeding times such dreadful gaps have made,\\n\\'Tis dangerous climbing: to your sons and you\\nI leave the ladder, and its omen too.\\nHind: The Panther\\'s breath was ever famed for sweet;\\nBut from the Wolf such wishes oft I meet:\\nYou learn\\'d this language from the Blatant Beast,                  \\nOr rather did not speak, but were possess\\'d.\\nAs for your answer, \\'tis but barely urged:\\nYou must evince Tradition to be forged;\\nProduce plain proofs: unblemish\\'d authors use\\nAs ancient as those ages they accuse;\\n\\'Till when \\'tis not sufficient to defame:\\nAn old possession stands, \\'till elder quits the claim.\\nThen for our interest, which is named alone\\nTo load with envy, we retort your own,\\nFor when Traditions in your faces fly,                             \\nResolving not to yield, you must decry.\\nAs when the cause goes hard, the guilty man\\nExcepts, and thins his jury all he can;\\nSo when you stand of other aid bereft,\\nYou to the Twelve Apostles would be left.\\nYour friend the Wolf did with more craft provide\\nTo set those toys, Traditions, quite aside;\\nAnd Fathers too, unless when, reason spent,\\nHe cites them but sometimes for ornament.\\nBut, madam Panther, you, though more sincere,                      \\nAre not so wise as your adulterer:\\nThe private spirit is a better blind,\\nThan all the dodging tricks your authors find.\\nFor they, who left the Scripture to the crowd,\\nEach for his own peculiar judge allow\\'d;\\nThe way to please them was to make them proud.\\nThus, with full sails, they ran upon the shelf:\\nWho could suspect a cozenage from himself?\\nOn his own reason safer \\'tis to stand,\\nThan be deceived and damn\\'d at second-hand.                        \\nBut you, who Fathers and Traditions take,\\nAnd garble some, and some you quite forsake,\\nPretending Church-authority to fix,\\nAnd yet some grains of private spirit mix,\\nAre like a mule, made up of differing seed,\\nAnd that\\'s the reason why you never breed;\\nAt least not propagate your kind abroad,\\nFor home dissenters are by statutes awed.\\nAnd yet they grow upon you every day,\\nWhile you, to speak the best, are at a stay,                       \\nFor sects, that are extremes, abhor a middle way.\\nLike tricks of state, to stop a raging flood,\\nOr mollify a mad-brain\\'d senate\\'s mood:\\nOf all expedients never one was good.\\nWell may they argue, nor can you deny,\\nIf we must fix on Church authority,\\nBest on the best, the fountain, not the flood;\\nThat must be better still, if this be good.\\nShall she command who has herself rebell\\'d?\\nIs Antichrist by Antichrist expell\\'d?                              \\nDid we a lawful tyranny displace,\\nTo set aloft a bastard of the race?\\nWhy all these wars to win the Book, if we\\nMust not interpret for ourselves, but she?\\nEither be wholly slaves, or wholly free.\\nFor purging fires Traditions must not fight;\\nBut they must prove Episcopacy\\'s right.\\nThus those led horses are from service freed;\\nYou never mount them but in time of need.\\nLike mercenaries, hired for home defence,                          \\nThey will not serve against their native prince.\\nAgainst domestic foes of hierarchy\\nThese are drawn forth, to make fanatics fly;\\nBut, when they see their countrymen at hand,\\nMarching against them under Church-command,\\nStraight they forsake their colours, and disband.\\nThus she, nor could the Panther well enlarge\\nWith weak defence against so strong a charge;\\nBut said: For what did Christ his Word provide,\\nIf still his Church must want a living guide?                      \\nAnd if all saving doctrines are not there,\\nOr sacred penmen could not make them clear,\\nFrom after ages we should hope in vain\\nFor truths, which men inspired could not explain.\\nBefore the Word was written, said the Hind,\\nOur Saviour preach\\'d his faith to human kind:\\nFrom his apostles the first age received\\nEternal truth, and what they taught believed.\\nThus by Tradition faith was planted first;\\nSucceeding flocks succeeding pastors nursed.                       \\nThis was the way our wise Redeemer chose\\n(Who sure could all things for the best dispose),\\nTo fence his fold from their encroaching foes.\\nHe could have writ himself, but well foresaw\\nThe event would be like that of Moses\\' law;\\nSome difference would arise, some doubts remain,\\nLike those which yet the jarring Jews maintain.\\nNo written laws can be so plain, so pure,\\nBut wit may gloss, and malice may obscure;\\nNot those indited by his first command,                            \\nA prophet graved the text, an angel held his hand.\\nThus faith was ere the written word appear\\'d,\\nAnd men believed not what they read, but heard.\\nBut since the apostles could not be confined\\nTo these, or those, but severally design\\'d\\nTheir large commission round the world to blow,\\nTo spread their faith, they spread their labours too.\\nYet still their absent flock their pains did share;\\nThey hearken\\'d still, for love produces care,\\nAnd, as mistakes arose, or discords fell,                          \\nOr bold seducers taught them to rebel,\\nAs charity grew cold, or faction hot,\\nOr long neglect their lessons had forgot,\\nFor all their wants they wisely did provide,\\nAnd preaching by epistles was supplied:\\nSo great physicians cannot all attend,\\nBut some they visit, and to some they send.\\nYet all those letters were not writ to all;\\nNor first intended but occasional,\\nTheir absent sermons; nor if they contain                          \\nAll needful doctrines, are those doctrines plain.\\nClearness by frequent preaching must be wrought:\\nThey writ but seldom, but they daily taught.\\nAnd what one saint has said of holy Paul,\\n\"He darkly writ,\" is true, applied to all.\\nFor this obscurity could Heaven provide\\nMore prudently than by a living guide,\\nAs doubts arose, the difference to decide?\\nA guide was therefore needful, therefore made;\\nAnd, if appointed, sure to be obey\\'d.                              \\nThus, with due reverence to the Apostle\\'s writ,\\nBy which my sons are taught, to which submit;\\nI think those truths their sacred works contain,\\nThe Church alone can certainly explain;\\nThat following ages, leaning on the past,\\nMay rest upon the Primitive at last.\\nNor would I thence the Word no rule infer,\\nBut none without the Church-interpreter.\\nBecause, as I have urged before, \\'tis mute,\\nAnd is itself the subject of dispute.                              \\nBut what the Apostles their successors taught,\\nThey to the next, from them to us is brought,\\nThe undoubted sense which is in Scripture sought.\\nFrom hence the Church is arm\\'d, when errors rise,\\nTo stop their entrance, and prevent surprise;\\nAnd, safe entrench\\'d within, her foes without defies.\\nBy these all festering sores her Councils heal,\\nWhich time or has disclosed, or shall reveal;\\nFor discord cannot end without a last appeal.\\nNor can a Council national decide,                                 \\nBut with subordination to her guide;\\n(I wish the cause were on that issue tried.)\\nMuch less the Scripture; for suppose debate\\nBetwixt pretenders to a fair estate,\\nBequeath\\'d by some legator\\'s last intent;\\n(Such is our dying Saviour\\'s Testament:)\\nThe will is proved, is open\\'d, and is read;\\nThe doubtful heirs their differing titles plead:\\nAll vouch the words their interest to maintain,\\nAnd each pretends by those his cause is plain.                     \\nShall then the Testament award the right?\\nNo, that\\'s the Hungary for which they fight;\\nThe field of battle, subject of debate;\\nThe thing contended for, the fair estate.\\nThe sense is intricate, \\'tis only clear\\nWhat vowels and what consonants are there.\\nTherefore \\'tis plain, its meaning must be tried\\nBefore some judge appointed to decide.\\nSuppose, the fair apostate said, I grant,\\nThe faithful flock some living guide should want,                  \\nYour arguments an endless chase pursue;\\nProduce this vaunted leader to our view,\\nThis mighty Moses of the chosen crew.\\nThe dame, who saw her fainting foe retired,\\nWith force renew\\'d, to victory aspired;\\nAnd, looking upward to her kindred sky,\\nAs once our Saviour own\\'d his Deity,\\nPronounced his words:--\"She whom ye seek am I,\"\\nNor less amazed this voice the Panther heard,\\nThan were those Jews to hear a God declared.                       \\nThen thus the matron modestly renew\\'d:\\nLet all your prophets and their sects be view\\'d,\\nAnd see to which of them yourselves think fit\\nThe conduct of your conscience to submit:\\nEach proselyte would vote his doctor best,\\nWith absolute exclusion to the rest:\\nThus would your Polish diet disagree,\\nAnd end, as it began, in anarchy:\\nYourself the fairest for election stand,\\nBecause you seem crown-general of the land:                        \\nBut soon against your superstitious lawn\\nSome Presbyterian sabre would be drawn:\\nIn your establish\\'d laws of sovereignty\\nThe rest some fundamental flaw would see,\\nAnd call rebellion gospel-liberty.\\nTo Church-decrees your articles require\\nSubmission modified, if not entire.\\nHomage denied, to censures you proceed:\\nBut when Curtana will not do the deed.\\nYou lay that pointless clergy-weapon by,                           \\nAnd to the laws, your sword of justice, fly.\\nNow this your sects the more unkindly take\\n(Those prying varlets hit the blots you make),\\nBecause some ancient friends of yours declare,\\nYour only rule of faith the Scriptures are,\\nInterpreted by men of judgment sound,\\nWhich every sect will for themselves expound;\\nNor think less reverence to their doctors due\\nFor sound interpretation, than to you.\\nIf then, by able heads, are understood                             \\nYour brother prophets, who reform\\'d abroad;\\nThose able heads expound a wiser way,\\nThat their own sheep their shepherd should obey.\\nBut if you mean yourselves are only sound,\\nThat doctrine turns the Reformation round,\\nAnd all the rest are false reformers found;\\nBecause in sundry points you stand alone,\\nNot in communion join\\'d with any one;\\nAnd therefore must be all the Church, or none.\\nThen, till you have agreed whose judge is best,                    \\nAgainst this forced submission they protest:\\nWhile sound and sound a different sense explains,\\nBoth play at hardhead till they break their brains;\\nAnd from their chairs each other\\'s force defy,\\nWhile unregarded thunders vainly fly.\\nI pass the rest, because your Church alone\\nOf all usurpers best could fill the throne.\\nBut neither you, nor any sect beside,\\nFor this high office can be qualified,\\nWith necessary gifts required in such a guide.                     \\nFor that which must direct the whole must be\\nBound in one bond of faith and unity:\\nBut all your several Churches disagree.\\nThe consubstantiating Church and priest\\nRefuse communion to the Calvinist:\\nThe French reform\\'d from preaching you restrain,\\nBecause you judge their ordination vain;\\nAnd so they judge of yours, but donors must ordain.\\nIn short, in doctrine, or in discipline,\\nNot one reform\\'d can with another join:                            \\nBut all from each, as from damnation, fly;\\nNo union they pretend, but in Non-Popery.\\nNor, should their members in a Synod meet,\\nCould any Church presume to mount the seat,\\nAbove the rest, their discords to decide;\\nNone would obey, but each would be the guide:\\nAnd face to face dissensions would increase;\\nFor only distance now preserves the peace.\\nAll in their turns accusers, and accused:\\nBabel was never half so much confused:                             \\nWhat one can plead, the rest can plead as well;\\nFor amongst equals lies no last appeal,\\nAnd all confess themselves are fallible.\\nNow since you grant some necessary guide,\\nAll who can err are justly laid aside:\\nBecause a trust so sacred to confer                                \\nShows want of such a sure interpreter;\\nAnd how can he be needful who can err?\\nThen, granting that unerring guide we want,\\nThat such there is you stand obliged to grant:                     \\nOur Saviour else were wanting to supply\\nOur needs, and obviate that necessity.\\nIt then remains, the Church can only be\\nThe guide, which owns unfailing certainty;\\nOr else you slip your hold, and change your side,\\nRelapsing from a necessary guide.\\nBut this annex\\'d condition of the crown,\\nImmunity from errors, you disown;\\nHere then you shrink, and lay your weak pretensions down.\\nFor petty royalties you raise debate;                              \\nBut this unfailing universal state\\nYou shun; nor dare succeed to such a glorious weight;\\nAnd for that cause those promises detest\\nWith which our Saviour did his Church invest;\\nBut strive to evade, and fear to find them true,\\nAs conscious they were never meant to you:\\nAll which the Mother Church asserts her own,\\nAnd with unrivall\\'d claim ascends the throne.\\nSo, when of old the Almighty Father sate\\nIn council, to redeem our ruin\\'d state,                            \\nMillions of millions, at a distance round,\\nSilent the sacred consistory crown\\'d,\\nTo hear what mercy, mix\\'d with justice, could propound:\\nAll prompt, with eager pity, to fulfil\\nThe full extent of their Creator\\'s will.\\nBut when the stern conditions were declared,\\nA mournful whisper through the host was heard,\\nAnd the whole hierarchy, with heads hung down,\\nSubmissively declined the ponderous proffer\\'d crown.\\nThen, not till then, the Eternal Son from high                     \\nRose in the strength of all the Deity:\\nStood forth to accept the terms, and underwent\\nA weight which all the frame of heaven had bent.\\nNor he himself could bear, but as Omnipotent.\\nNow, to remove the least remaining doubt,\\nThat even the blear-eyed sects may find her out,\\nBehold what heavenly rays adorn her brows,\\nWhat from his wardrobe her beloved allows\\nTo deck the wedding-day of his unspotted spouse.\\nBehold what marks of majesty she brings;                           \\nRicher than ancient heirs of eastern kings!\\nHer right hand holds the sceptre and the keys,\\nTo show whom she commands, and who obeys:\\nWith these to bind, or set the sinner free,\\nWith that to assert spiritual royalty.\\nOne in herself, not rent by schism, but sound,\\nEntire, one solid shining diamond;\\nNot sparkles shatter\\'d into sects like you:\\nOne is the Church, and must be to be true:\\nOne central principle of unity.                                    \\nAs undivided, so from errors free,\\nAs one in faith, so one in sanctity.\\nThus she, and none but she, the insulting rage\\nOf heretics opposed from age to age:\\nStill when the giant-brood invades her throne,\\nShe stoops from heaven, and meets them half way down,\\nAnd with paternal thunder vindicates her crown.\\nBut like Egyptian sorcerers you stand,\\nAnd vainly lift aloft your magic wand,\\nTo sweep away the swarms of vermin from the land:                  \\nYou could like them, with like infernal force,\\nProduce the plague, but not arrest the course.\\nBut when the boils and blotches, with disgrace                     \\nAnd public scandal, sat upon the face,\\nThemselves attack\\'d, the Magi strove no more,\\nThey saw God\\'s finger, and their fate deplore;\\nThemselves they could not cure of the dishonest sore.\\nThus one, thus pure, behold her largely spread,\\nLike the fair ocean from her mother-bed;\\nFrom east to west triumphantly she rides,                          \\nAll shores are water\\'d by her wealthy tides.\\nThe Gospel-sound, diffused from pole to pole,\\nWhere winds can carry, and where waves can roll,\\nThe self-same doctrine of the sacred page\\nConvey\\'d to every clime, in every age.\\nHere let my sorrow give my satire place,\\nTo raise new blushes on my British race;\\nOur sailing-ships like common sewers we use,\\nAnd through our distant colonies diffuse\\nThe draught of dungeons, and the stench of stews,                  \\nWhom, when their home-bred honesty is lost,\\nWe disembogue on some far Indian coast:\\nThieves, panders, paillards, sins of every sort;\\nThose are the manufactures we export;\\nAnd these the missioners our zeal has made:\\nFor, with my country\\'s pardon be it said,\\nReligion is the least of all our trade.\\nYet some improve their traffic more than we;\\nFor they on gain, their only god, rely,\\nAnd set a public price on piety.                                   \\nIndustrious of the needle and the chart,\\nThey run full sail to their Japonian mart;\\nPrevention fear, and, prodigal of fame,\\nSell all of Christian, to the very name;\\nNor leave enough of that, to hide their naked shame.\\nThus, of three marks, which in the Creed we view,\\nNot one of all can be applied to you:                              \\nMuch less the fourth; in vain, alas! you seek\\nThe ambitious title of Apostolic:\\nGod-like descent! \\'tis well your blood can be\\nProved noble in the third or fourth degree:\\nFor all of ancient that you had before,\\n(I mean what is not borrow\\'d from our store)\\nWas error fulminated o\\'er and o\\'er;\\nOld heresies condemn\\'d in ages past,\\nBy care and time recover\\'d from the blast.\\n\\'Tis said with ease, but never can be proved,\\nThe Church her old foundations has removed,\\nAnd built new doctrines on unstable sands:\\nJudge that, ye winds and rains: you proved her, yet she stands.    \\nThose ancient doctrines charged on her for new,\\nShow when and how, and from what hands they grew.\\nWe claim no power, when heresies grow bold,\\nTo coin new faith, but still declare the old.\\nHow else could that obscene disease be purged,\\nWhen controverted texts are vainly urged?\\nTo prove tradition new, there\\'s somewhat more\\nRequired, than saying, \\'twas not used before.\\nThose monumental arms are never stirr\\'d,\\nTill schism or heresy call down Goliah\\'s sword.                    \\nThus, what you call corruptions, are, in truth,\\nThe first plantations of the Gospel\\'s youth;\\nOld standard faith: but cast your eyes again,\\nAnd view those errors which new sects maintain,\\nOr which of old disturb\\'d the Church\\'s peaceful reign;\\nAnd we can point each period of the time,\\nWhen they began, and who begot the crime;\\nCan calculate how long the eclipse endured,\\nWho interposed, what digits were obscured:\\nOf all which are already pass\\'d away,                              \\nWe know the rise, the progress, and decay.\\nDespair at our foundations then to strike,\\nTill you can prove your faith Apostolic;\\nA limpid stream drawn from the native source;\\nSuccession lawful in a lineal course.\\nProve any Church, opposed to this our head,\\nSo one, so pure, so unconfinedly spread,\\nUnder one chief of the spiritual state,\\nThe members all combined, and all subordinate.\\nShow such a seamless coat, from schism so free,                    \\nIn no communion join\\'d with heresy.\\nIf such a one you find, let truth prevail:\\nTill when your weights will in the balance fail:\\nA Church unprincipled kicks up the scale.\\nBut if you cannot think (nor sure you can\\nSuppose in God what were unjust in man)\\nThat He, the fountain of eternal grace,\\nShould suffer falsehood, for so long a space,\\nTo banish truth, and to usurp her place:\\nThat seven successive ages should be lost,                         \\nAnd preach damnation at their proper cost;\\nThat all your erring ancestors should die,\\nDrown\\'d in the abyss of deep idolatry:\\nIf piety forbid such thoughts to rise,\\nAwake, and open your unwilling eyes:\\nGod hath left nothing for each age undone,\\nFrom this to that wherein he sent his Son:\\nThen think but well of him, and half your work is done.\\nSee how his Church, adorn\\'d with every grace,                      \\nWith open arms, a kind forgiving face,\\nStands ready to prevent her long-lost son\\'s embrace.\\nNot more did Joseph o\\'er his brethren weep,\\nNor less himself could from discovery keep,\\nWhen in the crowd of suppliants they were seen,\\nAnd in their crew his best-loved Benjamin.\\nThat pious Joseph in the Church behold,\\nTo feed your famine, and refuse your gold:\\nThe Joseph you exiled, the Joseph whom you sold.\\nThus, while with heavenly charity she spoke,\\nA streaming blaze the silent shadows broke;                        \\nShot from the skies; a cheerful azure light:\\nThe birds obscene to forests wing\\'d their flight,\\nAnd gaping graves received the wandering guilty sprite.\\nSuch were the pleasing triumphs of the sky,\\nFor James his late nocturnal victory;\\nThe pledge of his Almighty Patron\\'s love,\\nThe fireworks which his angels made above.\\nI saw myself the lambent easy light\\nGild the brown horror, and dispel the night:\\nThe messenger with speed the tidings bore;                         \\nNews, which three labouring nations did restore;\\nBut Heaven\\'s own Nuntius was arrived before.\\nBy this, the Hind had reach\\'d her lonely cell,\\nAnd vapours rose, and dews unwholesome fell.\\nWhen she, by frequent observation wise,\\nAs one who long on heaven had fix\\'d her eyes,\\nDiscern\\'d a change of weather in the skies;\\nThe western borders were with crimson spread,\\nThe moon descending look\\'d all flaming red;\\nShe thought good manners bound her to invite                       \\nThe stranger dame to be her guest that night.\\n\\'Tis true, coarse diet, and a short repast,\\n(She said) were weak inducements to the taste\\nOf one so nicely bred, and so unused to fast:\\nBut what plain fare her cottage could afford,\\nA hearty welcome at a homely board,\\nWas freely hers; and, to supply the rest,\\nAn honest meaning, and an open breast:\\nLast, with content of mind, the poor man\\'s wealth,\\nA grace-cup to their common patron\\'s health.                       \\nThis she desired her to accept, and stay\\nFor fear she might be wilder\\'d in her way,\\nBecause she wanted an unerring guide;\\nAnd then the dew-drops on her silken hide\\nHer tender constitution did declare,\\nToo lady-like a long fatigue to bear,\\nAnd rough inclemencies of raw nocturnal air.\\nBut most she fear\\'d that, travelling so late,\\nSome evil-minded beasts might lie in wait,\\nAnd, without witness, wreak their hidden hate.                     \\nThe Panther, though she lent a listening ear,\\nHad more of lion in her than to fear:\\nYet, wisely weighing, since she had to deal\\nWith many foes, their numbers might prevail,\\nReturn\\'d her all the thanks she could afford,\\nAnd took her friendly hostess at her word:\\nWho, entering first her lowly roof, a shed\\nWith hoary moss, and winding ivy spread,\\nHonest enough to hide an humble hermit\\'s head,\\nThus graciously bespoke her welcome guest:                         \\nSo might these walls, with your fair presence blest,\\nBecome your dwelling-place of everlasting rest;\\nNot for a night, or quick revolving year;\\nWelcome an owner, not a sojourner.\\nThis peaceful seat my poverty secures;\\nWar seldom enters but where wealth allures:\\nNor yet despise it; for this poor abode\\nHas oft received, and yet receives a God;\\nA God victorious of the Stygian race\\nHere laid his sacred limbs, and sanctified the place,              \\nThis mean retreat did mighty Pan contain:\\nBe emulous of him, and pomp disdain,\\nAnd dare not to debase your soul to gain.\\nThe silent stranger stood amazed to see\\nContempt of wealth, and wilful poverty:\\nAnd, though ill habits are not soon controll\\'d,\\nA while suspended her desire of gold.\\nBut civilly drew in her sharpen\\'d paws,\\nNot violating hospitable laws;\\nAnd pacified her tail, and lick\\'d her frothy jaws.                 \\nThe Hind did first her country cates provide;\\nThen couch\\'d herself securely by her side.\\n\\nMuch malice, mingled with a little wit,\\nPerhaps may censure this mysterious writ:\\nBecause the Muse has peopled Caledon\\nWith Panthers, Bears, and Wolves, and beasts unknown,\\nAs if we were not stock\\'d with monsters of our own.\\nLet Ã†sop answer, who has set to view\\nSuch kinds as Greece and Phrygia never knew;\\nAnd mother Hubbard, in her homely dress,\\nHas sharply blamed a British Lioness;\\nThat queen, whose feast the factious rabble keep,                   \\nExposed obscenely naked and asleep.\\nLed by those great examples, may not I\\nThe wanted organs of their words supply?\\nIf men transact like brutes, \\'tis equal then\\nFor brutes to claim the privilege of men.\\nOthers our Hind of folly will indite,\\nTo entertain a dangerous guest by night.\\nLet those remember, that she cannot die\\nTill rolling time is lost in round eternity;\\nNor need she fear the Panther, though untamed,                      \\nBecause the Lion\\'s peace was now proclaim\\'d:\\nThe wary savage would not give offence,\\nTo forfeit the protection of her prince;\\nBut watch\\'d the time her vengeance to complete,\\nWhen all her furry sons in frequent senate met;\\nMeanwhile she quench\\'d her fury at the flood,\\nAnd with a lenten salad cool\\'d her blood.\\nTheir commons, though but coarse, were nothing scant,\\nNor did their minds an equal banquet want.\\nFor now the Hind, whose noble nature strove                         \\nTo express her plain simplicity of love,\\nDid all the honours of her house so well,\\nNo sharp debates disturb\\'d the friendly meal.\\nShe turn\\'d the talk, avoiding that extreme,\\nTo common dangers past, a sadly-pleasing theme;\\nRemembering every storm which toss\\'d the state,\\nWhen both were objects of the public hate,\\nAnd dropp\\'d a tear betwixt for her own children\\'s fate.\\nNor fail\\'d she then a full review to make\\nOf what the Panther suffer\\'d for her sake:                          ', 'Her lost esteem, her truth, her loyal care,\\nHer faith unshaken to an exiled heir,\\nHer strength to endure, her courage to defy;\\nHer choice of honourable infamy.\\nOn these, prolixly thankful, she enlarged;\\nThen with acknowledgment herself she charged;\\nFor friendship, of itself an holy tie,\\nIs made more sacred by adversity.\\nNow should they part, malicious tongues would say,\\nThey met like chance companions on the way,                         \\nWhom mutual fear of robbers had possess\\'d;\\nWhile danger lasted, kindness was profess\\'d;\\nBut that once o\\'er, the short-lived union ends;\\nThe road divides, and there divide the friends.\\nThe Panther nodded when her speech was done,\\nAnd thank\\'d her coldly in a hollow tone:\\nBut said her gratitude had gone too far\\nFor common offices of Christian care.\\nIf to the lawful heir she had been true,\\nShe paid but CÃ¦sar what was CÃ¦sar\\'s due.                            \\nI might, she added, with like praise describe\\nYour suffering sons, and so return your bribe:\\nBut incense from my hands is poorly prized;\\nFor gifts are scorn\\'d where givers are despised.\\nI served a turn, and then was cast away;\\nYou, like the gaudy fly, your wings display,\\nAnd sip the sweets, and bask in your great patron\\'s day.\\nThis heard, the matron was not slow to find\\nWhat sort of malady had seized her mind:\\nDisdain, with gnawing envy, fell despite,                           \\nAnd canker\\'d malice stood in open sight:\\nAmbition, interest, pride without control,\\nAnd jealousy, the jaundice of the soul;\\nRevenge, the bloody minister of ill,\\nWith all the lean tormentors of the will.\\n\\'Twas easy now to guess from whence arose\\nHer new-made union with her ancient foes,\\nHer forced civilities, her faint embrace,\\nAffected kindness with an alter\\'d face:\\nYet durst she not too deeply probe the wound,                       \\nAs hoping still the nobler parts were sound:\\nBut strove with anodynes to assuage the smart,\\nAnd mildly thus her medicine did impart.\\nComplaints of lovers help to ease their pain;\\nIt shows a rest of kindness to complain;\\nA friendship loath to quit its former hold;\\nAnd conscious merit may be justly bold.\\nBut much more just your jealousy would show,\\nIf others\\' good were injury to you:\\nWitness, ye heavens, how I rejoice to see                           \\nRewarded worth and rising loyalty!\\nYour warrior offspring that upheld the crown.\\nThe scarlet honour of your peaceful gown,\\nAre the most pleasing objects I can find,\\nCharms to my sight, and cordials to my mind:\\nWhen virtue spooms before a prosperous gale,\\nMy heaving wishes help to fill the sail;\\nAnd if my prayers for all the brave were heard,\\nCÃ¦sar should still have such, and such should still reward.\\nThe labour\\'d earth your pains have sow\\'d and till\\'d;              \\n\\'Tis just you reap the product of the field:\\nYours be the harvest, \\'tis the beggar\\'s gain\\nTo glean the fallings of the loaded wain.\\nSuch scatter\\'d ears as are not worth your care,\\nYour charity, for alms, may safely spare,\\nFor alms are but the vehicles of prayer.\\nMy daily bread is literally implored;\\nI have no barns nor granaries to hoard.\\nIf CÃ¦sar to his own his hand extends,\\nSay which of yours his charity offends:                            \\nYou know he largely gives to more than are his friends.\\nAre you defrauded when he feeds the poor?\\nOur mite decreases nothing of your store.\\nI am but few, and by your fare you see\\nMy crying sins are not of luxury.\\nSome juster motive sure your mind withdraws,\\nAnd makes you break our friendship\\'s holy laws;\\nFor barefaced envy is too base a cause.\\nShow more occasion for your discontent;\\nYour love, the Wolf, would help you to invent:                     \\nSome German quarrel, or, as times go now,\\nSome French, where force is uppermost, will do.\\nWhen at the fountain\\'s head, as merit ought\\nTo claim the place, you take a swilling draught,\\nHow easy \\'tis an envious eye to throw,\\nAnd tax the sheep for troubling streams below;\\nOr call her (when no farther cause you find)\\nAn enemy possess\\'d of all your kind!\\nBut then, perhaps, the wicked world would think,\\nThe Wolf design\\'d to eat as well as drink.                         \\nThis last allusion gall\\'d the Panther more,\\nBecause indeed it rubb\\'d upon the sore.\\nYet seem\\'d she not to wince, though shrewdly pain\\'d:\\nBut thus her passive character maintain\\'d.\\nI never grudged, whate\\'er my foes report,\\nYour flaunting fortune in the Lion\\'s court.\\nYou have your day, or you are much belied,\\nBut I am always on the suffering side:\\nYou know my doctrine, and I need not say,\\nI will not, but I cannot disobey.                                  \\nOn this firm principle I ever stood;\\nHe of my sons who fails to make it good,\\nBy one rebellious act renounces to my blood.\\nAh, said the Hind, how many sons have you,\\nWho call you mother, whom you never knew!\\nBut most of them who that relation plead,\\nAre such ungracious youths as wish you dead.\\nThey gape at rich revenues which you hold,\\nAnd fain would nibble at your grandame Gold;\\nInquire into your years, and laugh to find                         \\nYour crazy temper shows you much declined.\\nWere you not dim and doted, you might see\\nA pack of cheats that claim a pedigree,\\nNo more of kin to you, than you to me.\\nDo you not know, that for a little coin,\\nHeralds can foist a name into the line?\\nThey ask you blessing but for what you have;\\nBut once possess\\'d of what with care you save,\\nThe wanton boys would piss upon your grave.\\nYour sons of latitude that court your grace,                     \\nThough most resembling you in form and face.\\nAre far the worst of your pretended race.\\nAnd, but I blush your honesty to blot,\\nPray God you prove them lawfully begot:\\nFor in some Popish libels I have read,\\nThe Wolf has been too busy in your bed;\\nAt least her hinder parts, the belly-piece,\\nThe paunch, and all that Scorpio claims, are his.\\nTheir malice too a sore suspicion brings;\\nFor though they dare not bark, they snarl at kings:                \\nNor blame them for intruding in your line;\\nFat bishoprics are still of right divine.\\nThink you your new French proselytes are come\\nTo starve abroad, because they starved at home?\\nYour benefices twinkled from afar;\\nThey found the new Messiah by the star:\\nThose Swisses fight on any side for pay,\\nAnd \\'tis the living that conforms, not they.\\nMark with what management their tribes divide,\\nSome stick to you, and some to the other side,                     \\nThat many churches may for many mouths provide.\\nMore vacant pulpits would more converts make;\\nAll would have latitude enough to take:\\nThe rest unbeneficed your sects maintain;\\nFor ordinations without cures are vain,\\nAnd chamber practice is a silent gain.\\nYour sons of breadth at home are much like these;\\nTheir soft and yielding metals run with ease:\\nThey melt, and take the figure of the mould;\\nBut harden and preserve it best in gold.                           \\nYour Delphic sword, the Panther then replied,\\nIs double-edged, and cuts on either side.\\nSome sons of mine, who bear upon their shield\\nThree steeples argent in a sable field,\\nHave sharply tax\\'d your converts, who unfed\\nHave follow\\'d you for miracles of bread;\\nSuch who themselves of no religion are,\\nAllured with gain, for any will declare.\\nBare lies with bold assertions they can face;\\nBut dint of argument is out of place.                              \\nThe grim logician puts them in a fright;\\n\\'Tis easier far to flourish than to fight.\\nThus our eighth Henry\\'s marriage they defame;\\nThey say the schism of beds began the game,\\nDivorcing from the Church to wed the dame:\\nThough largely proved, and by himself profess\\'d,\\nThat conscience, conscience would not let him rest:\\nI mean, not till possess\\'d of her he loved,\\nAnd old, uncharming Catherine was removed.\\nFor sundry years before he did complain,                           \\nAnd told his ghostly confessor his pain.\\nWith the same impudence without a ground,\\nThey say, that look the Reformation round,\\nNo Treatise of Humility is found.\\nBut if none were, the gospel does not want;\\nOur Saviour preach\\'d it, and I hope you grant,\\nThe Sermon on the Mount was Protestant.\\nNo doubt, replied the Hind, as sure as all\\nThe writings of Saint Peter and Saint Paul:\\nOn that decision let it stand or fall.                             \\nNow for my converts, who, you say, unfed,\\nHave follow\\'d me for miracles of bread;\\nJudge not by hearsay, but observe at least,\\nIf since their change their loaves have been increased.\\nThe Lion buys no converts; if he did,\\nBeasts would be sold as fast as he could bid.\\nTax those of interest who conform for gain,\\nOr stay the market of another reign:\\nYour broad-way sons would never be too nice\\nTo close with Calvin, if he paid their price;                      \\nBut, raised three steeples higher, would change their note,\\nAnd quit the cassock for the canting-coat.\\nNow, if you damn this censure, as too bold,\\nJudge by yourselves, and think not others sold.\\nMeantime my sons, accused by fame\\'s report,\\nPay small attendance at the Lion\\'s court,\\nNor rise with early crowds, nor flatter late;\\nFor silently they beg who daily wait.\\nPreferment is bestow\\'d, that comes unsought;\\nAttendance is a bribe, and then \\'tis bought.                       \\nHow they should speed, their fortune is untried;\\nFor not to ask, is not to be denied.\\nFor what they have, their God and king they bless,\\nAnd hope they should not murmur, had they less.\\nBut if reduced, subsistence to implore,\\nIn common prudence they should pass your door.\\nUnpitied Hudibras, your champion friend,\\nHas shown how far your charities extend.\\nThis lasting verse shall on his tomb be read,\\n\"He shamed you living, and upbraids you dead.\"                     \\nWith odious atheist names you load your foes;\\nYour liberal clergy why did I expose?\\nIt never fails in charities like those.\\nIn climes where true religion is profess\\'d,\\nThat imputation were no laughing jest.\\nBut imprimatur, with a chaplain\\'s name,\\nIs here sufficient licence to defame.\\nWhat wonder is\\'t that black detraction thrives?\\nThe homicide of names is less than lives;\\nAnd yet the perjured murderer survives.                            \\nThis said, she paused a little, and suppress\\'d\\nThe boiling indignation of her breast.\\nShe knew the virtue of her blade, nor would\\nPollute her satire with ignoble blood:\\nHer panting foe she saw before her eye,\\nAnd back she drew the shining weapon dry.\\nSo when the generous Lion has in sight\\nHis equal match, he rouses for the fight;\\nBut when his foe lies prostrate on the plain,\\nHe sheaths his paws, uncurls his angry mane,                       \\nAnd, pleased with bloodless honours of the day,\\nWalks over and disdains the inglorious prey.\\nSo James, if great with less we may compare,\\nArrests his rolling thunderbolts in air!\\nAnd grants ungrateful friends a lengthen\\'d space,\\nTo implore the remnants of long-suffering grace.\\nThis breathing-time the matron took; and then\\nResumed the thread of her discourse again.\\nBe vengeance wholly left to powers divine,\\nAnd let Heaven judge betwixt your sons and mine:                   \\nIf joys hereafter must be purchased here\\nWith loss of all that mortals hold so dear,\\nThen welcome infamy and public shame,\\nAnd, last, a long farewell to worldly fame.\\n\\'Tis said with ease, but, oh, how hardly tried\\nBy haughty souls to human honour tied!\\nO sharp convulsive pangs of agonizing pride!\\nDown then, thou rebel, never more to rise,\\nAnd what thou didst, and dost, so dearly prize,\\nThat fame, that darling fame, make that thy sacrifice.             \\n\\'Tis nothing thou hast given, then add thy tears\\nFor a long race of unrepenting years:\\n\\'Tis nothing yet, yet all thou hast to give:\\nThen add those may-be years thou hast to live:\\nYet nothing still; then poor, and naked come:\\nThy father will receive his unthrift home,\\nAnd thy blest Saviour\\'s blood discharge the mighty sum.\\nThus (she pursued) I discipline a son,\\nWhose uncheck\\'d fury to revenge would run:\\nHe champs the bit, impatient of his loss,                          \\nAnd starts aside, and flounders at the Cross.\\nInstruct him better, gracious God, to know,\\nAs thine is vengeance, so forgiveness too:\\nThat, suffering from ill tongues, he bears no more\\nThan what his sovereign bears, and what his Saviour bore.\\nIt now remains for you to school your child,\\nAnd ask why God\\'s anointed he reviled;\\nA king and princess dead! did Shimei worse?\\nThe cursor\\'s punishment should fright the curse:\\nYour son was warn\\'d, and wisely gave it o\\'er,                      \\nBut he who counsell\\'d him has paid the score:\\nThe heavy malice could no higher tend,\\nBut woe to him on whom the weights descend.\\nSo to permitted ills the Demon flies;\\nHis rage is aim\\'d at him who rules the skies:\\nConstrain\\'d to quit his cause, no succour found,\\nThe foe discharges every tire around,\\nIn clouds of smoke abandoning the fight;\\nBut his own thundering peals proclaim his flight.\\nIn Henry\\'s change his charge as ill succeeds;                     \\nTo that long story little answer needs:\\nConfront but Henry\\'s words with Henry\\'s deeds.\\nWere space allow\\'d, with ease it might be proved,\\nWhat springs his blessed Reformation moved.\\nThe dire effects appear\\'d in open sight,\\nWhich from the cause he calls a distant flight,\\nAnd yet no larger leap than from the sun to light.\\nNow let your sons a double pÃ¦an sound,\\nA Treatise of Humility is found.\\n\\'Tis found, but better it had ne\\'er been sought,                   \\nThan thus in Protestant procession brought.\\nThe famed original through Spain is known,\\nRodriguez\\' work, my celebrated son,\\nWhich yours, by ill-translating, made his own;\\nConceal\\'d its author, and usurp\\'d the name,\\nThe basest and ignoblest theft of fame.\\nMy altars kindled first that living coal;\\nRestore, or practice better, what you stole:\\nThat virtue could this humble verse inspire,\\n\\'Tis all the restitution I require.                                \\nGlad was the Panther that the charge was closed,\\nAnd none of all her favourite sons exposed.\\nFor laws of arms permit each injured man,\\nTo make himself a saver where he can.\\nPerhaps the plunder\\'d merchant cannot tell\\nThe names of pirates in whose hands he fell;\\nBut at the den of thieves he justly flies,\\nAnd every Algerine is lawful prize.\\nNo private person in the foe\\'s estate\\nCan plead exemption from the public fate.                          \\nYet Christian laws allow not such redress;\\nThen let the greater supersede the less.\\nBut let the abettors of the Panther\\'s crime\\nLearn to make fairer wars another time.\\nSome characters may sure be found to write\\nAmong her sons; for \\'tis no common sight,\\nA spotted dam, and all her offspring white.\\nThe savage, though she saw her plea controll\\'d,\\nYet would not wholly seem to quit her hold,\\nBut offer\\'d fairly to compound the strife,                         \\nAnd judge conversion by the convert\\'s life.\\n\\'Tis true, she said, I think it somewhat strange,\\nSo few should follow profitable change:\\nFor present joys are more to flesh and blood,\\nThan a dull prospect of a distant good.\\n\\'Twas well alluded by a son of mine\\n(I hope to quote him is not to purloin),\\nTwo magnets, heaven and earth, allure to bliss;\\nThe larger loadstone that, the nearer this:\\nThe weak attraction of the greater fails;                          \\nWe nod a while, but neighbourhood prevails:\\nBut when the greater proves the nearer too,\\nI wonder more your converts come so slow.\\nMethinks in those who firm with me remain,\\nIt shows a nobler principle than gain.\\nYour inference would be strong, the Hind replied,\\nIf yours were in effect the suffering side:\\nYour clergy\\'s sons their own in peace possess,\\nNor are their prospects in reversion less.\\nMy proselytes are struck with awful dread;                         \\nYour bloody comet-laws hang blazing o\\'er their head;\\nThe respite they enjoy but only lent,\\nThe best they have to hope, protracted punishment.\\nBe judge yourself, if interest may prevail,\\nWhich motives, yours or mine, will turn the scale.\\nWhile pride and pomp allure, and plenteous ease,\\nThat is, till man\\'s predominant passions cease,\\nAdmire no longer at my slow increase.\\nBy education most have been misled;\\nSo they believe, because they so were bred.                        \\nThe priest continues what the nurse began,\\nAnd thus the child imposes on the man.\\nThe rest I named before, nor need repeat:\\nBut interest is the most prevailing cheat,\\nThe sly seducer both of age and youth;\\nThey study that, and think they study truth.\\nWhen interest fortifies an argument,\\nWeak reason serves to gain the will\\'s assent;\\nFor souls, already warp\\'d, receive an easy bent.\\nAdd long prescription of establish\\'d laws,                         \\nAnd pique of honour to maintain a cause,\\nAnd shame of change, and fear of future ill,\\nAnd zeal, the blind conductor of the will;\\nAnd chief among the still-mistaking crowd,\\nThe fame of teachers obstinate and proud,\\nAnd, more than all, the private judge allow\\'d;\\nDisdain of Fathers which the dance began,\\nAnd last, uncertain whose the narrower span,\\nThe clown unread, and half-read gentleman.\\nTo this the Panther, with a scornful smile:                      \\nYet still you travel with unwearied toil,\\nAnd range around the realm without control,\\nAmong my sons for proselytes to prowl,\\nAnd here and there you snap some silly soul.\\nYou hinted fears of future change in state;\\nPray heaven you did not prophesy your fate!\\nPerhaps you think your time of triumph near,\\nBut may mistake the season of the year;\\nThe Swallow\\'s fortune gives you cause to fear.\\nFor charity, replied the matron, tell                            \\nWhat sad mischance those pretty birds befell.\\nNay, no mischance, the savage dame replied,\\nBut want of wit in their unerring guide,\\nAnd eager haste, and gaudy hopes, and giddy pride.\\nYet, wishing timely warning may prevail,\\nMake you the moral, and I\\'ll tell the tale.\\nThe Swallow, privileged above the rest\\nOf all the birds, as man\\'s familiar guest,\\nPursues the sun in summer, brisk and bold,\\nBut wisely shuns the persecuting cold:                             \\nIs well to chancels and to chimneys known,\\nThough \\'tis not thought she feeds on smoke alone.\\nFrom hence she has been held of heavenly line,\\nEndued with particles of soul divine.\\nThis merry chorister had long possess\\'d\\nHer summer seat, and feather\\'d well her nest:\\nTill frowning skies began to change their cheer,\\nAnd time turn\\'d up the wrong side of the year;\\nThe shedding trees began the ground to strow\\nWith yellow leaves, and bitter blasts to blow.                     \\nSad auguries of winter thence she drew,\\nWhich by instinct, or prophecy, she knew:\\nWhen prudence warn\\'d her to remove betimes,\\nAnd seek a better heaven, and warmer climes.\\nHer sons were summon\\'d on a steeple\\'s height,\\nAnd, call\\'d in common council, vote a flight;\\nThe day was named, the next that should be fair:\\nAll to the general rendezvous repair,\\nThey try their fluttering wings, and trust themselves in air.\\nBut whether upward to the moon they go,                            \\nOr dream the winter out in caves below,\\nOr hawk at flies elsewhere, concerns us not to know.\\nSouthwards, you may be sure, they bent their flight,\\nAnd harbour\\'d in a hollow rock at night:\\nNext morn they rose, and set up every sail;\\nThe wind was fair, but blew a mackerel gale:\\nThe sickly young sat shivering on the shore,\\nAbhorr\\'d salt water never seen before,\\nAnd pray\\'d their tender mothers to delay\\nThe passage, and expect a fairer day.                              \\nWith these the Martin readily concurr\\'d,\\nA church-begot, and church-believing bird;\\nOf little body, but of lofty mind,\\nRound-bellied, for a dignity design\\'d,\\nAnd much a dunce, as Martins are by kind.\\nYet often quoted Canon-laws, and Code,\\nAnd Fathers which he never understood;\\nBut little learning needs in noble blood.\\nFor, sooth to say, the Swallow brought him in,\\nHer household chaplain, and her next of kin:                       \\nIn superstition silly to excess,\\nAnd casting schemes by planetary guess:\\nIn fine, short-wing\\'d, unfit himself to fly,\\nHis fears foretold foul weather in the sky.\\nBesides, a Raven from a wither\\'d oak,\\nLeft of their lodging, was observed to croak.\\nThat omen liked him not; so his advice\\nWas present safety, bought at any price;\\nA seeming pious care, that cover\\'d cowardice.\\nTo strengthen this, he told a boding dream                         \\nOf rising waters, and a troubled stream,\\nSure signs of anguish, dangers, and distress,\\nWith something more, not lawful to express:\\nBy which he slily seem\\'d to intimate\\nSome secret revelation of their fate.\\nFor he concluded, once upon a time,\\nHe found a leaf inscribed with sacred rhyme,\\nWhose antique characters did well denote\\nThe Sibyl\\'s hand of the CumÃ¦an grot:\\nThe mad divineress had plainly writ,                               \\nA time should come (but many ages yet),\\nIn which, sinister destinies ordain,\\nA dame should drown with all her feather\\'d train,\\nAnd seas from thence be call\\'d the Chelidonian main.\\nAt this, some shook for fear, the more devout\\nArose, and bless\\'d themselves from head to foot.\\n\\'Tis true, some stagers of the wiser sort\\nMade all these idle wonderments their sport:\\nThey said, their only danger was delay,\\nAnd he, who heard what every fool could say,                       \\nWould never fix his thought, but trim his time away.\\nThe passage yet was good; the wind, \\'tis true,\\nWas somewhat high, but that was nothing new,\\nNo more than usual equinoxes blew.\\nThe sun, already from the Scales declined,\\nGave little hopes of better days behind,\\nBut change, from bad to worse, of weather and of wind.\\nNor need they fear the dampness of the sky\\nShould flag their wings, and hinder them to fly\\n\\'Twas only water thrown on sails too dry.                          \\nBut, least of all, philosophy presumes\\nOf truth in dreams, from melancholy fumes:\\nPerhaps the Martin, housed in holy ground,\\nMight think of ghosts that walk their midnight round,\\nTill grosser atoms, tumbling in the stream\\nOf fancy, madly met, and clubb\\'d into a dream:\\nAs little weight his vain presages bear,\\nOf ill effect to such alone who fear:\\nMost prophecies are of a piece with these,\\nEach Nostradamus can foretell with ease:                           \\nNot naming persons, and confounding times,\\nOne casual truth supports a thousand lying rhymes.\\nThe advice was true; but fear had seized the most,\\nAnd all good counsel is on cowards lost.\\nThe question crudely put to shun delay,\\n\\'Twas carried by the major part to stay.\\nHis point thus gain\\'d, Sir Martin dated thence\\nHis power, and from a priest became a prince.\\nHe order\\'d all things with a busy care,\\nAnd cells and refectories did prepare,                             \\nAnd large provisions laid of winter fare:\\nBut now and then let fall a word or two\\nOf hope, that Heaven some miracle might show,\\nAnd for their sakes the sun should backward go;\\nAgainst the laws of nature upward climb, \\nAnd, mounted on the Ram, renew the prime:\\nFor which two proofs in sacred story lay,\\nOf Ahaz\\' dial, and of Joshua\\'s day.\\nIn expectation of such times as these,\\nA chapel housed them, truly call\\'d of ease:                        \\nFor Martin much devotion did not ask:\\nThey pray\\'d sometimes, and that was all their task.\\nIt happen\\'d, as beyond the reach of wit\\nBlind prophecies may have a lucky hit,\\nThat this accomplish\\'d, or at least in part,\\nGave great repute to their new Merlin\\'s art.\\nSome Swifts, the giants of the Swallow kind,\\nLarge-limb\\'d, stout-hearted, but of stupid mind\\n(For Swisses, or for Gibeonites design\\'d),\\nThese lubbers, peeping through a broken pane,                      \\nTo suck fresh air, survey\\'d the neighbouring plain;\\nAnd saw (but scarcely could believe their eyes)\\nNew blossoms flourish, and new flowers arise;\\nAs God had been abroad, and, walking there,\\nHad left his footsteps, and reform\\'d the year:\\nThe sunny hills from far were seen to glow\\nWith glittering beams, and in the meads below\\nThe burnish\\'d brooks appear\\'d with liquid gold to flow.\\nAt last they heard the foolish Cuckoo sing,\\nWhose note proclaim\\'d the holiday of spring.                       \\nNo longer doubting, all prepare to fly,\\nAnd repossess their patrimonial sky.\\nThe priest before them did his wings display;\\nAnd that good omens might attend their way,\\nAs luck would have it, \\'twas St Martin\\'s day.\\nWho but the Swallow triumphs now alone?\\nThe canopy of heaven is all her own:\\nHer youthful offspring to their haunts repair,\\nAnd glide along in glades, and skim in air,\\nAnd dip for insects in the purling springs,                        \\nAnd stoop on rivers to refresh their wings.\\nTheir mothers think a fair provision made,\\nThat every son can live upon his trade:\\nAnd, now the careful charge is off their hands,\\nLook out for husbands, and new nuptial bands:\\nThe youthful widow longs to be supplied;\\nBut first the lover is by lawyers tied\\nTo settle jointure-chimneys on the bride.\\nSo thick they couple, in so short a space,\\nThat Martin\\'s marriage-offerings rise apace.\\nTheir ancient houses running to decay,\\nAre furbish\\'d up, and cemented with clay;                          \\nThey teem already; store of eggs are laid,\\nAnd brooding mothers call Lucina\\'s aid.\\nFame spreads the news, and foreign fowls appear\\nIn flocks to greet the new returning year,\\nTo bless the founder, and partake the cheer.\\nAnd now \\'twas time (so fast their numbers rise)\\nTo plant abroad, and people colonies.\\nThe youth drawn forth, as Martin had desired                       \\n(For so their cruel destiny required),\\nWere sent far off on an ill-fated day;\\nThe rest would needs conduct them on their way,\\nAnd Martin went, because he fear\\'d alone to stay.\\nSo long they flew with inconsiderate haste,\\nThat now their afternoon began to waste;\\nAnd, what was ominous, that very morn\\nThe sun was enter\\'d into Capricorn;\\nWhich, by their bad astronomer\\'s account,\\nThat week the Virgin balance should remount.                       \\nAn infant moon eclipsed him in his way,\\nAnd hid the small remainders of his day.\\nThe crowd, amazed, pursued no certain mark;\\nBut birds met birds, and jostled in the dark:\\nFew mind the public in a panic fright;\\nAnd fear increased the horror of the night.\\nNight came, but unattended with repose;\\nAlone she came, no sleep their eyes to close:\\nAlone, and black she came; no friendly stars arose.\\nWhat should they do, beset with dangers round,                   \\nNo neighbouring dorp, no lodging to be found,\\nBut bleaky plains, and bare unhospitable ground.\\nThe latter brood, who just began to fly,\\nSick-feather\\'d, and unpractised in the sky,\\nFor succour to their helpless mother call:\\nShe spread her wings; some few beneath them crawl;\\nShe spread them wider yet, but could not cover all.\\nTo augment their woes, the winds began to move,\\nDebate in air, for empty fields above,\\nTill Boreas got the skies, and pour\\'d amain                        \\nHis rattling hailstones mix\\'d with snow and rain.\\nThe joyless morning late arose, and found\\nA dreadful desolation reign around--\\nSome buried in the snow, some frozen to the ground.\\nThe rest were struggling still with death, and lay\\nThe Crows\\' and Ravens\\' rights, an undefended prey:\\nExcepting Martin\\'s race; for they and he\\nHad gain\\'d the shelter of a hollow tree:\\nBut soon discover\\'d by a sturdy clown,\\nHe headed all the rabble of a town,                                \\nAnd finish\\'d them with bats, or poll\\'d them down.\\nMartin himself was caught alive, and tried\\nFor treasonous crimes, because the laws provide\\nNo Martin there in winter shall abide.\\nHigh on an oak, which never leaf shall bear,\\nHe breathed his last, exposed to open air;\\nAnd there his corpse, unbless\\'d, is hanging still,\\nTo show the change of winds with his prophetic bill.\\nThe patience of the Hind did almost fail;\\nFor well she mark\\'d the malice of the tale;                   \\nWhich ribald art their Church to Luther owes;\\nIn malice it began, by malice grows;\\nHe sow\\'d the Serpent\\'s teeth, an iron-harvest rose.\\nBut most in Martin\\'s character and fate,\\nShe saw her slander\\'d sons, the Panther\\'s hate,\\nThe people\\'s rage, the persecuting state:\\nThen said, I take the advice in friendly part;\\nYou clear your conscience, or at least your heart:\\nPerhaps you fail\\'d in your foreseeing skill,\\nFor Swallows are unlucky birds to kill:                            \\nAs for my sons, the family is bless\\'d,\\nWhose every child is equal to the rest;\\nNo Church reform\\'d can boast a blameless line;\\nSuch Martins build in yours, and more than mine:\\nOr else an old fanatic author lies,\\nWho summ\\'d their scandals up by centuries.\\nBut through your parable I plainly see\\nThe bloody laws, the crowd\\'s barbarity;\\nThe sunshine that offends the purblind sight:\\nHad some their wishes, it would soon be night.                     \\nMistake me not; the charge concerns not you:\\nYour sons are malcontents, but yet are true,\\nAs far as non-resistance makes them so;\\nBut that\\'s a word of neutral sense, you know,\\nA passive term, which no relief will bring,\\nBut trims betwixt a rebel and a king.\\nRest well assured, the Pardelis replied,\\nMy sons would all support the regal side,\\nThough Heaven forbid the cause by battle should be tried.\\nThe matron answer\\'d with a loud Amen,                            \\nAnd thus pursued her argument again.\\nIf, as you say, and as I hope no less,\\nYour sons will practise what yourselves profess,\\nWhat angry power prevents our present peace?\\nThe Lion, studious of our common good,\\nDesires (and kings\\' desires are ill withstood)\\nTo join our nations in a lasting love;\\nThe bars betwixt are easy to remove;\\nFor sanguinary laws were never made above.\\nIf you condemn that prince of tyranny,                             \\nWhose mandate forced your Gallic friends to fly,\\nMake not a worse example of your own;\\nOr cease to rail at causeless rigour shown,\\nAnd let the guiltless person throw the stone.\\nHis blunted sword your suffering brotherhood\\nHave seldom felt; he stops it short of blood:\\nBut you have ground the persecuting knife,\\nAnd set it to a razor edge on life.\\nCursed be the wit, which cruelty refines,\\nOr to his father\\'s rod the scorpion\\'s joins!                       \\nYour finger is more gross than the great monarch\\'s loins.\\nBut you, perhaps, remove that bloody note,\\nAnd stick it on the first reformer\\'s coat.\\nOh, let their crime in long oblivion sleep!\\n\\'Twas theirs indeed to make, \\'tis yours to keep.\\nUnjust, or just, is all the question now;\\n\\'Tis plain, that not repealing you allow.\\nTo name the Test would put you in a rage;\\nYou charge not that on any former age,\\nBut smile to think how innocent you stand,                         \\nArm\\'d by a weapon put into your hand,\\nYet still remember that you wield a sword\\nForged by your foes against your sovereign lord;\\nDesign\\'d to hew the imperial cedar down,\\nDefraud succession, and dis-heir the crown.\\nTo abhor the makers, and their laws approve,\\nIs to hate traitors, and the treason love.\\nWhat means it else, which now your children say,\\nWe made it not, nor will we take away?\\nSuppose some great oppressor had by slight                        \\nOf law, disseised your brother of his right,\\nYour common sire surrendering in a fright;\\nWould you to that unrighteous title stand,\\nLeft by the villain\\'s will to heir the land?\\nMore just was Judas, who his Saviour sold;\\nThe sacrilegious bribe he could not hold,\\nNor hang in peace, before he render\\'d back the gold.\\nWhat more could you have done, than now you do,\\nHad Oates and Bedlow, and their plot been true?\\nSome specious reasons for those wrongs were found;                 \\nTheir dire magicians threw their mists around,\\nAnd wise men walk\\'d as on enchanted ground.\\nBut now when time has made the imposture plain\\n(Late though he follow\\'d truth, and limping held her train),\\nWhat new delusion charms your cheated eyes again?\\nThe painted harlot might a while bewitch,\\nBut why the hag uncased, and all obscene with itch?\\nThe first Reformers were a modest race;\\nOur peers possess\\'d in peace their native place;\\nAnd when rebellious arms o\\'erturn\\'d the state,                     \\nThey suffer\\'d only in the common fate:\\nBut now the Sovereign mounts the regal chair,\\nAnd mitred seats are full, yet David\\'s bench is bare.\\nYour answer is, they were not dispossess\\'d;\\nThey need but rub their metal on the test\\nTo prove their ore: \\'twere well if gold alone\\nWere touch\\'d and tried on your discerning stone;\\nBut that unfaithful Test unsound will pass\\nThe dross of atheists, and sectarian brass:\\nAs if the experiment were made to hold                             \\nFor base production, and reject the gold.\\nThus men ungodded may to places rise,\\nAnd sects may be preferr\\'d without disguise:\\nNo danger to the Church or State from these;\\nThe Papist only has his writ of ease.\\nNo gainful office gives him the pretence\\nTo grind the subject, or defraud the prince.\\nWrong conscience, or no conscience, may deserve\\nTo thrive, but ours alone is privileged to starve.\\nStill thank yourselves, you cry; your noble race                   \\nWe banish not, but they forsake the place;\\nOur doors are open: true, but ere they come,\\nYou toss your \\'censing Test, and fume the room;\\nAs if \\'twere Toby\\'s rival to expel,\\nAnd fright the fiend who could not bear the smell.\\nTo this the Panther sharply had replied;\\nBut having gain\\'d a verdict on her side,\\nShe wisely gave the loser leave to chide;\\nWell satisfied to have the But and Peace,\\nAnd for the plaintiff\\'s cause she cared the less,                  \\nBecause she sued in _forma pauperis_;\\nYet thought it decent something should be said;\\nFor secret guilt by silence is betray\\'d.\\nSo neither granted all, nor much denied,\\nBut answer\\'d with a yawning kind of pride:\\nMethinks such terms of proffer\\'d peace you bring,\\nAs once Ã†neas to the Italian king:\\nBy long possession all the land is mine;\\nYou strangers come with your intruding line,\\nTo share my sceptre, which you call to join.                       \\nYou plead, like him, an ancient pedigree,\\nAnd claim a peaceful seat by fate\\'s decree.\\nIn ready pomp your sacrificer stands,\\nTo unite the Trojan and the Latin bands,\\nAnd, that the league more firmly may be tied,\\nDemand the fair Lavinia for your bride.\\nThus plausibly you veil the intended wrong,\\nBut still you bring your exiled gods along;\\nAnd will endeavour, in succeeding space,\\nThose household puppets on our hearths to place.                   \\nPerhaps some barbarous laws have been preferr\\'d;\\nI spake against the Test, but was not heard;\\nThese to rescind, and peerage to restore,\\nMy gracious Sovereign would my vote implore:\\nI owe him much, but owe my conscience more.\\nConscience is then your plea, replied the dame,\\nWhich, well inform\\'d, will ever be the same.\\nBut yours is much of the chameleon hue,\\nTo change the dye with every distant view.\\nWhen first the Lion sat with awful sway,                           \\nYour conscience taught your duty to obey:\\nHe might have had your Statutes and your Test;\\nNo conscience but of subjects was profess\\'d.\\nHe found your temper, and no farther tried,\\nBut on that broken reed, your Church, relied.\\nIn vain the sects assay\\'d their utmost art,\\nWith offer\\'d treasure to espouse their part;\\nTheir treasures were a bribe too mean to move his heart.\\nBut when, by long experience, you had proved,\\nHow far he could forgive, how well he loved;                       \\nA goodness that excell\\'d his godlike race,\\nAnd only short of Heaven\\'s unbounded grace;\\nA flood of mercy that o\\'erflow\\'d our isle,\\nCalm in the rise, and fruitful as the Nile;\\nForgetting whence our Egypt was supplied,\\nYou thought your sovereign bound to send the tide:\\nNor upward look\\'d on that immortal spring,\\nBut vainly deem\\'d, he durst not be a king:\\nThen Conscience, unrestrain\\'d by fear, began\\nTo stretch her limits, and extend the span;                        \\nDid his indulgence as her gift dispose,\\nAnd made a wise alliance with her foes.\\nCan Conscience own the associating name,\\nAnd raise no blushes to conceal her shame?\\nFor sure she has been thought a bashful dame.\\nBut if the cause by battle should be tried,\\nYou grant she must espouse the regal side:\\nO Proteous Conscience, never to be tied!\\nWhat Phoebus from the Tripod shall disclose,\\nWhich are, in last resort, your friends or foes?                   \\nHomer, who learn\\'d the language of the sky,\\nThe seeming Gordian knot would soon untie;\\nImmortal powers the term of Conscience know,\\nBut Interest is her name with men below.\\nConscience or Interest be \\'t, or both in one,\\nThe Panther answer\\'d in a surly tone,\\nThe first commands me to maintain the crown,\\nThe last forbids to throw my barriers down.\\nOur penal laws no sons of yours admit,\\nOur Test excludes your tribe from benefit.                         \\nThese are my banks your ocean to withstand,\\nWhich, proudly rising, overlooks the land;\\nAnd, once let in, with unresisted sway,\\nWould sweep the pastors and their flocks away.\\nThink not my judgment leads me to comply\\nWith laws unjust, but hard necessity;\\nImperious need, which cannot be withstood,\\nMakes ill authentic, for a greater good.\\nPossess your soul with patience, and attend:\\nA more auspicious planet may ascend;                               \\nGood fortune may present some happier time,\\nWith means to cancel my unwilling crime;\\n(Unwilling, witness all ye Powers above!)\\nTo mend my errors, and redeem your love:\\nThat little space you safely may allow;\\nYour all-dispensing power protects you now.\\nHold, said the Hind, \\'tis needless to explain;\\nYou would postpone me to another reign;\\nTill when you are content to be unjust:\\nYour part is to possess, and mine to trust.                        \\nA fair exchange proposed of future chance,\\nFor present profit and inheritance.\\nFew words will serve to finish our dispute;\\nWho will not now repeal, would persecute.\\nTo ripen green revenge your hopes attend,\\nWishing that happier planet would ascend.\\nFor shame let Conscience be your plea no more:\\nTo will hereafter, proves she might before;\\nBut she\\'s a bawd to gain, and holds the door.\\nYour care about your banks infers a fear                         \\nOf threatening floods and inundations near;\\nIf so, a just reprise would only be\\nOf what the land usurp\\'d upon the sea;\\nAnd all your jealousies but serve to show\\nYour ground is, like your neighbour-nation, low.\\nTo intrench in what you grant unrighteous laws,\\nIs to distrust the justice of your cause;\\nAnd argues that the true religion lies\\nIn those weak adversaries you despise.\\nTyrannic force is that which least you fear;                      \\nThe sound is frightful in a Christian\\'s ear:\\nAvert it, Heaven! nor let that plague be sent\\nTo us from the dispeopled continent.\\nBut piety commands me to refrain;\\nThose prayers are needless in this monarch\\'s reign.\\nBehold! how he protects your friends oppress\\'d,\\nReceives the banish\\'d, succours the distress\\'d:\\nBehold, for you may read an honest open breast.\\nHe stands in day-light, and disdains to hide\\nAn act, to which by honour he is tied,                             \\nA generous, laudable, and kingly pride.\\nYour Test he would repeal, his peers restore;\\nThis when he says he means, he means no more.\\nWell, said the Panther, I believe him just,\\nAnd yet----\\nAnd yet, \\'tis but because you must;\\nYou would be trusted, but you would not trust.\\nThe Hind thus briefly; and disdain\\'d to enlarge\\nOn power of kings, and their superior charge,\\nAs Heaven\\'s trustees before the people\\'s choice:                   \\nThough sure the Panther did not much rejoice\\nTo hear those echoes given of her once loyal voice.\\nThe matron woo\\'d her kindness to the last,\\nBut could not win; her hour of grace was past.\\nWhom, thus persisting, when she could not bring\\nTo leave the Wolf, and to believe her king,\\nShe gave her up, and fairly wish\\'d her joy\\nOf her late treaty with her new ally:\\nWhich well she hoped would more successful prove,\\nThan was the Pigeon\\'s and the Buzzard\\'s love.                      \\nThe Panther ask\\'d what concord there could be\\nBetwixt two kinds whose natures disagree?\\nThe dame replied: \\'Tis sung in every street,\\nThe common chat of gossips when they meet;\\nBut, since unheard by you, \\'tis worth your while\\nTo take a wholesome tale, though told in homely style.\\nA plain good man, whose name is understood\\n(So few deserve the name of plain and good),\\nOf three fair lineal lordships stood possess\\'d,\\nAnd lived, as reason was, upon the best.                           \\nInured to hardships from his early youth,\\nMuch had he done, and suffer\\'d for his truth:\\nAt land and sea, in many a doubtful fight,\\nWas never known a more adventurous knight,\\nWho oftener drew his sword, and always for the right.\\nAs fortune would (his fortune came, though late)\\nHe took possession of his just estate:\\nNor rack\\'d his tenants with increase of rent;\\nNor lived too sparing, nor too largely spent;\\nBut overlook\\'d his hinds; their pay was just,                      \\nAnd ready, for he scorn\\'d to go on trust:\\nSlow to resolve, but in performance quick;\\nSo true, that he was awkward at a trick.\\nFor little souls on little shifts rely,\\nAnd coward arts of mean expedients try;\\nThe noble mind will dare do anything but lie.\\nFalse friends, his deadliest foes, could find no way\\nBut shows of honest bluntness, to betray:\\nThat unsuspected plainness he believed;\\nHe looked into himself, and was deceived.                          \\nSome lucky planet sure attends his birth,\\nOr Heaven would make a miracle on earth;\\nFor prosperous honesty is seldom seen\\nTo bear so dead a weight, and yet to win.\\nIt looks as fate with nature\\'s law would strive,\\nTo show plain-dealing once an age may thrive:\\nAnd, when so tough a frame she could not bend,\\nExceeded her commission to befriend.\\nThis grateful man, as Heaven increased his store.\\nGave God again, and daily fed his poor.                            \\nHis house with all convenience was purvey\\'d;\\nThe rest he found, but raised the fabric where he pray\\'d;\\nAnd in that sacred place his beauteous wife\\nEmploy\\'d her happiest hours of holy life.\\nNor did their alms extend to those alone,\\nWhom common faith more strictly made their own;\\nA sort of Doves were housed too near their hall,\\nWho cross the proverb, and abound with gall.\\nThough some, \\'tis true, are passively inclined,\\nThe greater part degenerate from their kind;                       \\nVoracious birds, that hotly bill and breed,\\nAnd largely drink, because on salt they feed.\\nSmall gain from them their bounteous owner draws;\\nYet, bound by promise, he supports their cause,\\nAs corporations privileged by laws.\\nThat house which harbour to their kind affords,\\nWas built, long since, God knows for better birds;', 'But fluttering there, they nestle near the throne,\\nAnd lodge in habitations not their own,\\nBy their high crops and corny gizzards known.                      \\nLike Harpies, they could scent a plenteous board,\\nThen to be sure they never fail\\'d their lord:\\nThe rest was form, and bare attendance paid;\\nThey drank, and ate, and grudgingly obey\\'d.\\nThe more they fed, they raven\\'d still for more;\\nThey drain\\'d from Dan, and left Beersheba poor.\\nAll this they had by law, and none repined;\\nThe preference was but due to Levi\\'s kind;\\nBut when some lay-preferment fell by chance,\\nThe gourmands made it their inheritance.                           \\nWhen once possess\\'d, they never quit their claim;\\nFor then \\'tis sanctified to Heaven\\'s high name;\\nAnd, hallow\\'d thus, they cannot give consent,\\nThe gift should be profaned by worldly management.\\nTheir flesh was never to the table served;\\nThough \\'tis not thence inferr\\'d the birds were starved;\\nBut that their master did not like the food,\\nAs rank, and breeding melancholy blood.\\nNor did it with his gracious nature suit,\\nEven though they were not Doves, to persecute:                     \\nYet he refused (nor could they take offence)\\nTheir glutton kind should teach him abstinence.\\nNor consecrated grain their wheat he thought,\\nWhich, new from treading, in their bills they brought:\\nBut left his hinds each in his private power,\\nThat those who like the bran might leave the flour.\\nHe for himself, and not for others, chose,\\nNor would he be imposed on, nor impose;\\nBut in their faces his devotion paid,\\nAnd sacrifice with solemn rites was made,                          \\nAnd sacred incense on his altars laid.\\nBesides these jolly birds, whose corpse impure\\nRepaid their commons with their salt-manure;\\nAnother farm he had behind his house,\\nNot overstock\\'d, but barely for his use:\\nWherein his poor domestic poultry fed,\\nAnd from his pious hands received their bread.\\nOur pamper\\'d Pigeons, with malignant eyes,\\nBeheld these inmates, and their nurseries:\\nThough hard their fare, at evening, and at morn,                  \\nA cruise of water and an ear of corn;\\nYet still they grudged that modicum, and thought\\nA sheaf in every single grain was brought.\\nFain would they filch that little food away,\\nWhile unrestrain\\'d those happy gluttons prey.\\nAnd much they grieved to see so nigh their hall,\\nThe bird that warn\\'d St Peter of his fall;\\nThat he should raise his mitred crest on high,\\nAnd clap his wings, and call his family\\nTo sacred rites; and vex the ethereal powers                      \\nWith midnight matins at uncivil hours:\\nNay more, his quiet neighbours should molest,\\nJust in the sweetness of their morning rest.\\nBeast of a bird, supinely when he might\\nLie snug and sleep, to rise before the light!\\nWhat if his dull forefathers used that cry,\\nCould he not let a bad example die?\\nThe world was fallen into an easier way;\\nThis age knew better than to fast and pray.\\nGood sense in sacred worship would appear                         \\nSo to begin, as they might end the year.\\nSuch feats in former times had wrought the falls\\nOf crowing Chanticleers in cloister\\'d walls.\\nExpell\\'d for this, and for their lands, they fled;\\nAnd sister Partlet, with her hooded head,\\nWas hooted hence, because she would not pray a-bed.\\nThe way to win the restive world to God,\\nWas to lay by the disciplining rod,\\nUnnatural fasts, and foreign forms of prayer:\\nReligion frights us with a mien severe.                           \\n\\'Tis prudence to reform her into ease,\\nAnd put her in undress to make her please;\\nA lively faith will bear aloft the mind,\\nAnd leave the luggage of good works behind.\\nSuch doctrines in the Pigeon-house were taught:\\nYou need not ask how wondrously they wrought:\\nBut sure the common cry was all for these,\\nWhose life and precepts both encouraged ease.\\nYet fearing those alluring baits might fail,\\nAnd holy deeds o\\'er all their arts prevail;                       \\n(For vice, though frontless, and of harden\\'d face,\\nIs daunted at the sight of awful grace;)\\nAn hideous figure of their foes they drew,\\nNor lines, nor looks, nor shades, nor colours true;\\nAnd this grotesque design exposed to public view.\\nOne would have thought it some Egyptian piece,\\nWith garden-gods, and barking deities,\\nMore thick than Ptolemy has stuck the skies.\\nAll so perverse a draught, so far unlike,\\nIt was no libel where it meant to strike.                         \\nYet still the daubing pleased, and great and small,\\nTo view the monster, crowded Pigeon Hall.\\nThere Chanticleer was drawn upon his knees\\nAdoring shrines, and stocks of sainted trees:\\nAnd by him, a misshapen, ugly race;\\nThe curse of God was seen on every face:\\nNo Holland emblem could that malice mend,\\nBut still the worse the look, the fitter for a fiend.\\nThe master of the farm, displeased to find\\nSo much of rancour in so mild a kind,                             \\nEnquired into the cause, and came to know,\\nThe passive Church had struck the foremost blow;\\nWith groundless fears and jealousies possess\\'d,\\nAs if this troublesome intruding guest\\nWould drive the birds of Venus from their nest;\\nA deed his inborn equity abhorr\\'d;\\nBut Interest will not trust, though God should plight his word.\\nA law, the source of many future harms,\\nHad banish\\'d all the poultry from the farms;\\nWith loss of life, if any should be found                         \\nTo crow or peck on this forbidden ground.\\nThat bloody statute chiefly was design\\'d\\nFor Chanticleer the white, of clergy kind;\\nBut after-malice did not long forget\\nThe lay that wore the robe and coronet.\\nFor them, for their inferiors and allies,\\nTheir foes a deadly Shibboleth devise:\\nBy which unrighteously it was decreed,\\nThat none to trust or profit should succeed,\\nWho would not swallow first a poisonous wicked weed:         \\nOr that, to which old Socrates was cursed,\\nOr henbane juice to swell them till they burst.\\nThe patron (as in reason) thought it hard\\nTo see this inquisition in his yard,\\nBy which the Sovereign was of subjects\\' use debarr\\'d.\\nAll gentle means he tried, which might withdraw\\nThe effects of so unnatural a law:\\nBut still the Dove-house obstinately stood\\nDeaf to their own and to their neighbours\\' good;\\nAnd which was worse, if any worse could be,                       \\nRepented of their boasted loyalty:\\nNow made the champions of a cruel cause.\\nAnd drunk with fumes of popular applause;\\nFor those whom God to ruin has design\\'d,\\nHe fits for fate, and first destroys their mind.\\nNew doubts indeed they daily strove to raise,\\nSuggested dangers, interposed delays;\\nAnd emissary Pigeons had in store,\\nSuch as the Meccan prophet used of yore,\\nTo whisper counsels in their patron\\'s ear;                        \\nAnd veil\\'d their false advice with zealous fear.\\nThe master smiled to see them work in vain,\\nTo wear him out, and make an idle reign:\\nHe saw, but suffer\\'d their protractive arts,\\nAnd strove by mildness to reduce their hearts:\\nBut they abused that grace to make allies,\\nAnd fondly closed with former enemies;\\nFor fools are doubly fools, endeavouring to be wise.\\nAfter a grave consult what course were best,\\nOne, more mature in folly than the rest,                          \\nStood up, and told them, with his head aside,\\nThat desperate cures must be to desperate ills applied:\\nAnd therefore, since their main impending fear\\nWas from the increasing race of Chanticleer,\\nSome potent bird of prey they ought to find,\\nA foe profess\\'d to him, and all his kind:\\nSome haggard Hawk, who had her eyrie nigh,\\nWell pounced to fasten, and well wing\\'d to fly;\\nOne they might trust, their common wrongs to wreak:\\nThe Musquet and the Coystrel were too weak,                       \\nToo fierce the Falcon; but, above the rest,\\nThe noble Buzzard ever pleased me best;\\nOf small renown, \\'tis true; for, not to lie,\\nWe call him but a Hawk by courtesy.\\nI know he hates the Pigeon-house and Farm,\\nAnd more, in time of war has done us harm:\\nBut all his hate on trivial points depends;\\nGive up our forms, and we shall soon be friends.\\nFor Pigeons\\' flesh he seems not much to care;\\nCramm\\'d chickens are a more delicious fare.                       \\nOn this high potentate, without delay,\\nI wish you would confer the sovereign sway:\\nPetition him to accept the government,\\nAnd let a splendid embassy be sent.\\nThis pithy speech prevail\\'d, and all agreed,\\nOld enmities forgot, the Buzzard should succeed.\\nTheir welcome suit was granted soon as heard,\\nHis lodgings furnish\\'d, and a train prepared,\\nWith B\\'s upon their breast, appointed for his guard.\\nHe came, and crown\\'d with great solemnity;                        \\nGod save king Buzzard, was the general cry.\\nA portly prince, and goodly to the sight,\\nHe seem\\'d a son of Anak for his height:\\nLike those whom stature did to crowns prefer:\\nBlack-brow\\'d, and bluff, like Homer\\'s Jupiter:\\nBroad-back\\'d, and brawny-built for love\\'s delight;\\nA prophet form\\'d to make a female proselyte.\\nA theologue more by need than genial bent;\\nBy breeding sharp, by nature

be his throne;\\nBeyond Love\\'s kingdom let him stretch his pen!--\\nHe paused, and all the people cried, Amen.\\nThen thus continued he: My son, advance\\nStill in new impudence, new ignorance.\\nSuccess let others teach, learn thou from me\\nPangs without birth, and fruitless industry.\\nLet Virtuosos in five years be writ;\\nYet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.                        \\nLet gentle George in triumph tread the stage,\\nMake Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;\\nLet Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,\\nAnd in their folly show the writer\\'s wit.\\nYet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,\\nAnd justify their author\\'s want of sense.\\nLet them be all by thy own model made\\nOf dulness, and desire no foreign aid;\\nThat they to future ages may be known,\\nNot copies drawn, but issue of thy own.                            \\nNay, let thy men of wit too be the same,\\nAll full of thee, and differing but in name.\\nBut let no alien Sedley interpose,\\nTo lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.\\nAnd when false flowers of rhetoric thou wouldst cull,\\nTrust nature, do not labour to be dull;\\nBut write thy best, and top; and, in each line,\\nSir Formal\\'s oratory will be thine:\\nSir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,\\nAnd does thy northern dedications fill.                            \\nNor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,\\nBy arrogating Jonson\\'s hostile name.\\nLet Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,\\nAnd uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.\\nThou art my blood, where Jonson has no part:\\nWhat share have we in nature, or in art?\\nWhere did his wit on learning fix a brand,\\nAnd rail at arts he did not understand?\\nWhere made he love in prince Nicander\\'s vein,\\nOr swept the dust in Psyche\\'s humble strain?                       \\nWhere sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my a--e,\\nPromised a play, and dwindled to a farce?\\nWhen did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,\\nAs thou whole Etheridge dost transfuse to thine?\\nBut so transfused, as oil and waters flow,\\nHis always floats above, thine sinks below.\\nThis is thy province, this thy wondrous way,\\nNew humours to invent for each new play:\\nThis is that boasted bias of thy mind,\\nBy which one way to dulness \\'tis inclined:                         \\nWhich makes thy writings lean on one side still,\\nAnd, in all changes, that way bends thy will.\\nNor let thy mountain-belly make pretence\\nOf likeness; thine\\'s a tympany of sense.\\nA tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,\\nBut sure thou\\'rt but a kilderkin of wit.\\nLike mine, thy gentle numbers feebly creep;\\nThy tragic muse gives smiles, thy comic sleep.\\nWith whate\\'er gall thou sett\\'st thyself to write,\\nThy inoffensive satires never bite.                                \\nIn thy felonious heart though venom lies,\\nIt does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.\\nThy genius calls thee not to purchase fame\\nIn keen Iambics, but mild Anagram.\\nLeave writing plays, and choose for thy command,\\nSome peaceful province in Acrostic land.\\nThere thou mayst wings display and altars raise,\\nAnd torture one poor word ten thousand ways.\\nOr, if thou wouldst thy different talents suit,\\nSet thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.                      \\nHe said; but his last words were scarcely heard:\\nFor Bruce and

prophet\\'s part,\\nWith double portion of his father\\'s art.\\n\\nOur vows are heard betimes! and Heaven takes care\\nTo grant, before we can conclude the prayer:\\nPreventing angels met it half the way,\\nAnd sent us back to praise, who came to pray.\\nJust on the day, when the high-mounted Sun\\nDid furthest in his northern progress run,\\nHe bended forward, and even stretch\\'d the sphere\\nBeyond the limits of the lengthen\\'d year,\\nTo view a brighter sun in Britain born;\\nThat was the business of his longest morn;                          \\nThe glorious object seen, \\'twas time to turn.\\nDeparting Spring could only stay to shed\\nHer bloomy beauties on the genial bed,\\nBut left the manly Summer in her stead,\\nWith timely fruit the longing land to cheer,\\nAnd to fulfil the promise of the year.\\nBetwixt two seasons comes the auspicious heir,\\nThis age to blossom, and the next to bear.\\nLast solemn Sabbath saw the Church attend,\\nThe Paraclete in fiery pomp descend;                                \\nBut when his wondrous octave roll\\'d again,\\nHe brought a royal infant in his train.\\nSo great a blessing to so good a king,\\nNone but the Eternal Comforter could bring.\\nOr did the mighty Trinity conspire,\\nAs once in council, to create our sire?\\nIt seems as if they sent the new-born guest\\nTo wait on the procession of their feast;\\nAnd on their sacred anniverse decreed\\nTo stamp their image on the promised seed.                          \\nThree realms united, and on one bestow\\'d,\\nAn emblem of their mystic union show\\'d:\\nThe

lie,\\nAnd hears the souls of saints beneath his altar cry.                \\nAlready has he lifted high the Sign,\\nWhich crown\\'d the conquering arms of Constantine;\\nThe Moon grows pale at that

            \\nWho durst her infant majesty oppose.\\nBut when his tender strength in time shall rise\\nTo dare ill tongues, and fascinating eyes;\\nThis isle, which hides the little Thunderer\\'s fame,\\nShall be too narrow to contain his name:\\nThe artillery of heaven shall make him known;\\nCrete could not hold the god, when Jove was grown.\\nAs Jove\\'s increase, who from his brain was born,\\nWhom arms and arts did equally adorn,                              \\nFree of the breast was bred, whose milky taste\\nMinerva\\'s name to Venus had debased;\\nSo this imperial babe rejects the food\\nThat mixes monarch\\'s with plebeian blood:\\nFood that his inborn courage might control,\\nExtinguish all the father in his soul,\\nAnd, for his Estian race, and Saxon strain,\\nMight reproduce some second Richard\\'s reign.\\nMildness he shares from both his parents\\' blood:\\nBut kings too tame are despicably good:                            \\nBe this the mixture of this regal child,\\nBy nature manly, but by virtue mild.\\nThus far the furious transport of the news\\nHad to prophetic madness fired the Muse;\\nMadness ungovernable, uninspired,\\nSwift to foretell whatever she desired.\\nWas it for me the dark abyss to tread,\\nAnd read the book which angels cannot read?\\nHow was I punish\\'d, when the sudden blast,\\nThe face of heaven, and our young sun o\\'ercast!                    \\nFame, the swift ill, increasing as she roll\\'d,\\nDisease, despair, and death, at three reprises told;\\nAt three insulting strides she stalk\\'d the town,\\nAnd, like contagion, struck the loyal down.\\nDown fell the winnow\\'d wheat; but, mounted high,\\nThe whirlwind bore the chaff, and hid the sky.\\nHere black rebellion shooting from below\\n(As earth\\'s gigantic brood by moments grow)\\nAnd here the sons of God are petrified with woe:\\nAn apoplex of grief: so low were driven                            \\nThe saints, as hardly to defend their heaven.\\nAs, when pent vapours run their hollow round,\\nEarthquakes, which are convulsions of the ground,\\nBreak bellowing forth, and no confinement brook,\\nTill the third settles what the former shook;\\nSuch heavings had our souls; till, slow and late,\\nOur life with his return\\'d, and Faith prevail\\'d on Fate.\\nBy prayers the mighty blessing was implored,\\nTo prayers was granted, and by prayers restored.\\nSo, ere the Shunamite a son conceived,                      \\nThe prophet promised, and the wife believed.\\nA son was sent, the son so much desired;\\nBut soon upon the mother\\'s knees expired.\\nThe troubled seer approach\\'d the mournful door,\\nRan, pray\\'d, and sent his pastoral staff before,\\nThen stretch\\'d his limbs upon the child, and mourn\\'d,\\nThus Mercy stretches out her hand, and saves\\nDesponding Peter sinking in the waves.\\nAs when a sudden storm of hail and rain                          \\nBeats to the ground the yet unbearded grain,\\nThink not the hopes of harvest are destroy\\'d\\nOn the flat field, and on the naked void;\\nThe light unloaded stem, from tempest freed,\\nWill raise the youthful honours of his head;\\nAnd soon, restored by native vigour, bear\\nThe timely product of the bounteous year.\\nNor yet conclude all fiery trials past:\\nFor Heaven will exercise us to the last;\\nSometimes will check us in our full career,                        \\nWith doubtful blessings, and with mingled fear;\\nThat, still depending on his daily grace,\\nHis every mercy for an alms may pass,\\nWith sparing hands will diet us to good;\\nPreventing surfeits of our pamper\\'d blood.\\nSo feeds the mother bird her craving young\\nWith little morsels, and delays them long.\\nTrue, this last blessing was a royal feast;\\nBut where\\'s the wedding-garment on the guest?\\nOur manners, as religion were a dream,                             \\nAre such as teach the nations to blaspheme.\\nIn lusts we wallow, and with pride we swell,\\nAnd injuries with injuries repel;\\nPrompt to revenge, not daring to forgive,\\nOur lives unteach the doctrine we believe.\\nThus Israel sinn\\'d, impenitently hard,\\nAnd vainly thought the present ark their guard;\\nBut when the haughty Philistines appear,\\nThey fled, abandon\\'d to their foes and fear;\\nTheir God was absent, though his ark was there.                    \\nAh! lest our crimes should snatch this pledge away,\\nAnd make our joys the blessings of a day!\\nFor we have sinn\\'d him hence, and that he lives,\\nGod to his promise, not our practice gives.\\nOur crimes would soon weigh down the guilty scale,\\nBut James and Mary, and the Church, prevail.\\nNor Amalek can rout the chosen bands,\\nWhile Hur and Aaron hold up Moses\\' hands.\\nBy living well, let us secure his days;\\nModerate in hopes, and humble in our ways,                         \\nNo force the free-born spirit can constrain,\\nBut charity and great examples gain.\\nForgiveness is our thanks for such a day:\\n\\'Tis god-like God in his own coin to pay.\\nBut you, propitious queen, translated here,\\nFrom your mild heaven, to rule our rugged sphere,\\nBeyond the sunny walks, and circling year:\\nYou, who your native climate have bereft\\nOf all the virtues, and the vices left;\\nWhom piety and beauty make their boast,                            \\nThough beautiful is well in pious lost;\\nSo lost, as star-light is dissolved away,\\nAnd melts into the brightness of the day;\\nOr gold about the regal diadem,\\nLost to improve the lustre of the gem.\\nWhat can we add to your triumphant day?\\nLet the great gift the beauteous giver pay.\\nFor should our thanks awake the rising sun,\\nAnd lengthen, as his latest shadows run,\\nThat, though the longest day, would soon, too soon be done.        \\nLet angels\\' voices with their harps conspire,\\nBut keep the auspicious infant from the quire;\\nLate let him sing above, and let us know\\nNo sweeter music than his cries below.\\nNor can I wish to you, great Monarch, more\\nThan such an annual income to your store;\\nThe day which gave this Unit, did not shine\\nFor a less omen, than to fill the Trine.\\nAfter a prince, an admiral beget;\\nThe Royal Sovereign wants an anchor yet.                           \\nOur isle has younger titles still in store,\\nAnd when the exhausted land can yield no more,\\nYour line can force them from a foreign shore.\\nThe name of Great your martial mind will suit;\\nBut justice is your darling attribute:\\nOf all the Greeks, \\'twas but one hero\\'s due,\\nAnd, in him, Plutarch prophesied of you.\\nA prince\\'s favours but on few can fall,\\nBut justice is a virtue shared by all.\\nSome kings the name of conquerors have assumed,                  \\nSome to be great, some to be gods presumed;\\nBut boundless power and arbitrary lust\\nMade tyrants still abhor the name of just;\\nThey shunn\\'d the praise this godlike virtue gives,\\nAnd fear\\'d a title that reproach\\'d their lives.\\nThe Power, from which all kings derive their state,\\nWhom they pretend, at least, to imitate,\\nIs equal both to punish and reward;\\nFor few would love their God, unless they fear\\'d.\\nResistless force and immortality                                 \\nMake but a lame, imperfect, deity:\\nTempests have force unbounded to destroy,\\nAnd deathless being, even the damn\\'d enjoy;\\nAnd yet Heaven\\'s attributes, both last and first,\\nOne without life, and one with life accurst:\\nBut justice is Heaven\\'s self, so strictly he,\\nThat could it fail, the Godhead could not be.\\nThis virtue is your own; but life and state', \"Are one to Fortune subject, one to Fate:\\nEqual to all, you justly frown or smile;                           \\nNor hopes nor fears your steady hand beguile;\\nYourself our balance hold, the world's our isle.\"]}\n"
